336	And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.	ecstasy delight	
337	Mmhmm.		
338	To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.	ecstasy delight	
339	But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
340	Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.	bliss ecstasy	
341	I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.	sadness	
342	And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
343	Do you still feel that way?		
344	I just want you to know Annie.	grief loathing	
345	Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?	ecstasy calmness	
346	Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
347	What would I do with a fortune?	serenity	
348	Good God.	rage terror	
349	Is it them?		
350	Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.	calmness joy	
351	It must be them then.		
352	It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?	annoyance	
353	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
354	We are okay, aren't we darling?	joy calmness	
355	Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry, what's that?	grief fear	
356	No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]	loathing fear	
357	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
358	With perfect poise.	bliss enthusiasm	
359	I think I shall do a curtsy.	anxiety	
360	It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?	joy	
361	Darling, don't say that.	bliss joy	
362	It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.	grief loathing	
363	What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?	bliss joy	
364	Yes.  Meaning just that.	ecstasy delight	
365	Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	bliss joy	
366	Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want.	bliss joy	
367	You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness.	grief loathing	
368	you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.	anger disgust	
369	Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.	ecstasy pleasantness	
370	How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
371	Who knows?		
372	Well it depends on how well we've played.	joy pleasantness	
373	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?	ecstasy	
374	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	eagerness pleasantness	
375	No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.	grief terror	
376	I think you are talking nonsense.	grief loathing	
377	Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run.	ecstasy delight	
378	Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.	sadness anger	
379	[LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
380	Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
381	Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.	fear anger	
382	The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.	fear dislike	
383	Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
384	[GARBAGE]	disgust	
385	It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.	sadness	
386	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
387	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
388	Uh huh.	anger	
389	But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	grief loathing	
390	That was a rouser, wasn't it?		
391	[LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me.	loathing sadness	
392	I did not hit you very hard.	delight joy	
393	The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	grief disgust	
394	[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
395	[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
396	[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.	disgust	
397	However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	bliss delight	
398	Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?	sadness fear	
399	It's not fair.	dislike	
400	Yeah.  I know.	serenity	
401	I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...	pleasantness serenity	
402	I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.	grief	
403	I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice.	grief dislike	
404	There's people that have given more though, you know?		
405	I know.		
406	I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.	terror	
407	I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to...		
408	like you sign up because you need money and	serenity acceptance	
409	things just aren't what they seem.		
410	This is a stupid war.	grief rage	
411	We're doing the right thing, though.		
412	I know.		
413	If not me then, who?		
414	What am I going to do? Huh?	anger	
415	You'll videotape everything, yeah?	grief loathing	
416	Yeah.	serenity	
417	Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?	serenity acceptance	
418	Last month--  Yeah.	serenity	
419	I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.	terror disgust	
420	I have to find sitters.		
421	I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?	disgust	
422	We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.	pleasantness	
423	And your mother is close by.	pleasantness	
424	And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.		
425	It's just not fair.	dislike	
426	About what I was saying.		
427	It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
428	It's a PR.		
429	Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
430	Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.	bliss joy	
431	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
432	I'm sorry it still just fish to me.	grief fear	
433	Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?	bliss	
434	Okay, well then what's bugging you?	pleasantness eagerness	
435	Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.	ecstasy bliss	
436	And then we go home and they go home.	calmness	
437	Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?		
438	We missed them twice.	grief loathing	
439	I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.	sadness fear	
440	Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards	ecstasy calmness	
441	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	grief rage	
442	and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.	ecstasy delight	
443	Of course not.	ecstasy calmness	
444	Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.	ecstasy delight	
445	We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
446	While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.	ecstasy delight	
447	Wait a minute, I've got it.	anxiety	
448	Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.	ecstasy pleasantness	
449	It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?	fear disgust	
450	You want this to be like the other times, right?	pleasantness	
451	I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	terror melancholy	
452	Do you want to dance?	ecstasy delight	
453	No.		
454	No.

460	No.		
461	A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?	grief rage	
462	You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think "Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska."	rage sadness	
463	No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--	delight eagerness	
464	No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.	ecstasy bliss	
465	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.		
466	Right.		
467	This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.	pleasantness	
468	This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?	ecstasy calmness	
469	I'm doing the best I can.	ecstasy delight	
470	I know that Augie, I really do.		
471	I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.	ecstasy delight	
472	Maybe if you were with somebody else too?		
473	I didn't say that.		
474	No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
475	Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
476	Yeah?	serenity

478	So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.	enthusiasm

485	Augie, I'm sorry.	grief fear

531	She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?		
532	Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.	pleasantness eagerness	
533	What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?	ecstasy delight	
534	[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.	grief

537	Oh.  So what.

539	Now listen.		
540	She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.		
541	You can't read her mind.	grief

546	I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.	joy responsiveness	
547	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.	grief loathing	
548	Calm yourself.	calmness

555	Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
556	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	ecstasy delight	
557	Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.	grief loathing	
558	It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.	pleasantness serenity	
559	It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.	ecstasy delight	
560	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	grief terror	
561	What of it?		
562	What about me?		
563	If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	enthusiasm delight	
564	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	pleasantness	
565	Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.	dislike melancholy

587	Yes I did, quite a lot.	ecstasy calmness	
588	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.	grief fear	
589	I think I am not in the least bit drunk.	joy eagerness	
590	You've always had a weak head.	anxiety	
591	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	fear sadness	
592	That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.	ecstasy delight	
593	Oh shut up.	annoyance	
594	Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.	sadness

653	That's my point.		
654	Then let's go.	acceptance	
655	No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.	loathing sadness	
656	Not particularly.		
657	Why not?		
658	I just don't, it's stupid.	grief rage	
659	It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.	ecstasy bliss	
660	I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.	terror loathing	
661	Yeah, they do.	serenity	
662	Oh, Augie.		
663	Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.	grief loathing	
664	It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	dislike annoyance	
665	All right.	ecstasy calmness	
666	I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...	ecstasy delight	
667	And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.	delight ecstasy	
668	Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	grief loathing	
669	We just weren't in a good spot though.	pleasantness	
670	We didn't see them the year before either.		
671	We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.	delight	
672	Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...	joy pleasantness	
673	They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...	ecstasy pleasantness	
674	Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...	terror rage	
675	And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...	ecstasy delight	
676	It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.	enthusiasm delight	
677	It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.	grief disgust	
678	That's the wind.		
679	Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.		
680	He saw it.	sadness fear	
681	How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
682	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
683	When?		
684	Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.	grief disgust	
685	I guess he is.		
686	It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
687	What?		
688	Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
689	What do you mean dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
690	What do you want to do?  Argue with him?	anger	
691	You can't say that to him.		
692	Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?	serenity acceptance	
693	For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.	loathing anger	
694	To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?	ecstasy delight	
695	It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--	ecstasy delight	
696	All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?	grief loathing	
697	Why?	annoyance	
698	You know.		
699	Well I got an idea, but what's your story?	grief disgust	
700	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
701	Well that's only your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
702	Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
703	Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --	eagerness acceptance	
704	Then it's not just my business.		
705	I'm just saying.		
706	You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	bliss enthusiasm	
707	She's not Larry's girl.		
708	From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.	joy eagerness	
709	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.	ecstasy delight	
710	You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.	ecstasy bliss	
711	To hell with that.	rage	
712	Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.	grief disgust	
713	And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.	serenity acceptance	
714	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.	sadness	
715	Why does it have to be Annie?	grief loathing	
716	Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.	annoyance dislike	
717	I don't know.		
718	I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.	grief loathing	
719	I don't want a diagram.	contentment acceptance	
720	He thinks he's coming back Chris.	sadness fear	
721	You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
722	...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.		
723	All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
724	Just give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
725	I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
726	But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.		
727	What the hell is this?	rage	
728	I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.	ecstasy delight	
729	Are you crazy?	dislike	
730	I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.	ecstasy delight	
731	You have a business here.  What the hell is this?	rage	
732	Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.	ecstasy pleasantness	
733	I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.	enthusiasm delight	
734	You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?		
735	On this, I would.		
736	Well you don't want to think like that.	pleasantness eagerness	
737	Then help me stay here.	grief terror	
738	All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.	rage fear	
739	Just don't think like that.		
740	Well I am thinking like that.	pleasantness eagerness	
741	I can see that.		
742	Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?		
743	Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?		
744	Yeah.	serenity	
745	No.  There's regular jobs on there.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
746	I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.	ecstasy bliss	
747	Uh huh.	anger	
748	I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.	ecstasy bliss	
749	He's like a manager for a theatre.	ecstasy delight	
750	Really?		
751	you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.	ecstasy bliss	
752	You did?		
753	Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.	sadness fear	
754	Yeah.	serenity	
755	He got it?	ecstasy bliss	
756	You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?	ecstasy delight	
757	It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	eagerness joy	
758	I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.	pleasantness	
759	Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.	eagerness acceptance	
760	Yeah.	serenity	
761	I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there.	ecstasy delight	
762	No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--		
763	I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.	pleasantness	
764	Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.	pleasantness	
765	Why?  It's a piece of paper.	annoyance	
766	I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--	pleasantness eagerness	
767	It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...	anger fear	
768	Yeah.	serenity	
769	Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.	ecstasy eagerness	
770	Please.		
771	maybe get a car.		
772	you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?	delight	
773	I didn't say that.		
774	You know, you're riding the bus, too.	ecstasy delight	
775	I am riding the bus, but by choice.	ecstasy pleasantness	
776	You're saving the environment. mmhmm	delight calmness	
777	Yes.  One less car at a time.	dislike	
778	Mmhmm.		
779	I'm not frustrated.	serenity	
780	...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.	sadness disgust	
781	I don't think I'm anyone.		
782	You are so high and mighty.  I just--	ecstasy pleasantness	
783	I- I-I didn't-- okay.	annoyance	
784	Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.	ecstasy delight	
785	What?  No.		
786	What? Oh.  So now you're...		
787	I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.	loathing	
788	Why not?		
789	Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.	serenity	
790	Can I help you?	pleasantness	
791	Uh huh.	anger

797	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
798	Uh-huh.	anger	
799	Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--	serenity	
800	I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-	grief loathing	
801	we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...	disgust fear	
802	Oh, Are you kidding me?	enthusiasm delight	
803	for such an inconvenience and your bag, but	joy	
804	Is this a joke?	grief loathing	
805	Yeah.	serenity	
806	Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.	enthusiasm delight	
807	No, no.  This is real.	delight	
808	No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...	anger	
809	this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.	grief loathing	
810	Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.	rage grief	
811	I know.		
812	We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.	bliss ecstasy	
813	I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.	loathing fear

826	What's your name?		
827	Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.		
828	Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.	ecstasy delight

830	If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--	anger

872	So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-	ecstasy delight	
873	this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.	ecstasy delight	
874	Oh.  She was there?

889	Umm. Yeah.	ecstasy delight	
890	And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...	ecstasy delight	
891	But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.	enthusiasm joy	
892	Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-	terror disgust	
893	So she wrote a lot of poetry?	ecstasy delight	
894	There's another one, I can't remember.	grief	
895	I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?	grief loathing	
896	Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.

964	For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.		
965	[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
966	What?		
967	You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	dislike	
968	I was kind of planning on sneaking up on you, you know over like a course of a week or so. They just take for granted that we're already set.	acceptance serenity	
969	I knew they would, your mother anyway.		
970	Yeah--	serenity	
971	Well I guess that's why I came.	pleasantness eagerness	
972	I love you a great deal.	ecstasy delight	
973	I'm sorry I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?  See, I didn't want to do it here I didn't on this porch, with this ring--I didn't want to win you away from anything.	rage sadness	
974	I've been ready a long, long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
975	I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
976	Why didn't you?		
977	You felt something that far back?		
978	Everyday since.		
979	why didn't you let me know?		
980	Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.	eagerness pleasantness	
981	I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.	ecstasy delight	
982	I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.	delight ecstasy	
983	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
984	Chris, what's the matter?

991	For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.	rage sadness	
992	He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.	enthusiasm delight	
993	They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...	ecstasy bliss	
994	And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...	ecstasy delight	
995	I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...	ecstasy delight	
996	And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.	grief disgust	
997	Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.	bliss ecstasy	
998	'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...	bliss delight	
999	And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.	rage terror	
1000	Do you still feel that way?		
1001	I want you to know Annie.	grief loathing	
1002	And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness

1014	Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?	delight	
1015	Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.	loathing sadness	
1016	We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.	ecstasy	
1017	For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.	grief loathing	
1018	Why not?		
1019	Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?		
1020	We've missed them twice.	grief loathing	
1021	Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.		
1022	They'll show up this time.

1026	I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...	ecstasy delight

1028	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.	terror grief	
1029	For God's sake, this is not about fish.	ecstasy delight	
1030	Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.	grief loathing	
1031	Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.	grief loathing	
1032	Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.	ecstasy delight	
1033	We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1034	You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1035	Wait a minute, I got it.	anxiety	
1036	Drinking champagne from the bottle,

1051	No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?	terror grief

1175	That's my point.		
1176	Wait, that's my point, too.	anxiety	
1177	Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.	ecstasy bliss	
1178	Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.	grief fear	
1179	Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1180	I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.	loathing grief	
1181	Yeah they do.	serenity	
1182	okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.	grief loathing	
1183	I'm just not.		
1184	God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?	ecstasy delight	
1185	Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	grief loathing	
1186	Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.	pleasantness joy	
1187	Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.	grief loathing	
1188	Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.		
1189	God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.	ecstasy delight	
1190	Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.	rage grief	
1191	They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.	ecstasy delight	
1192	It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.	delight enthusiasm	
1193	And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
1194	That's the wind.

1200	Did you talk to him?		
1201	No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.	anxiety	
1202	Cried hard?	sadness fear	
1203	What is he doing out here at that hour?		
1204	He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.	ecstasy delight	
1205	I guess he is.		
1206	It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
1207	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.	loathing	
1208	What?		
1209	I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?	grief anger	
1210	What do you want to do, argue with him?	anger	
1211	I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.	ecstasy delight	
1212	For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.	loathing anger	
1213	To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?	ecstasy delight	
1214	Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.	ecstasy calmness	
1215	The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1216	Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?	grief loathing	
1217	Why?	annoyance	
1218	Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?	grief disgust	
1219	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
1220	You know it's not just my business.		
1221	So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?	calmness	
1222	See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?	anger sadness	
1223	I'm just saying.		
1224	She is not Larry's girl.		
1225	From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.	grief loathing	
1226	I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1227	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.	ecstasy bliss	
1228	Did you ask Annie yet?	grief loathing	
1229	No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.	ecstasy bliss	
1230	Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1231	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	sadness	
1232	So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
1233	Because it is.		
1234	I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.	ecstasy delight	
1235	He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1236	Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.		
1237	Give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
1238	I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.	sadness fear	
1239	When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.	grief loathing	
1240	What the hell is this?	rage	
1241	I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.	ecstasy delight	
1242	Are you crazy?	dislike	
1243	I'll do it.	ecstasy bliss	
1244	You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?	rage	
1245	Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
1246	Oh, must you be inspired.	eagerness	
1247	Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1248	If that can't happen here...		
1249	You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.		
1250	Yes, on this I would.	ecstasy calmness	
1251	Well, you don't want to think like that.	pleasantness eagerness	
1252	Then help me stay here mom.	grief terror	
1253	All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.	rage fear	
1254	Then help me stay.	grief terror	
1255	I am thinking like that.		
1256	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
1257	Well, I can see that.	pleasantness eagerness	
1258	Why did he invite her here?	contentment acceptance	
1259	She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?		
1260	Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.	pleasantness eagerness	
1261	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	loathing	
1262	Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.	grief	
1263	She's not-		
1264	How do you know he's even thinking of it?		
1265	It's got that all about it.		
1266	Well, so what?	pleasantness eagerness	
1267	Now, listen Kate.		
1268	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.		
1269	You can't read her mind.	grief	
1270	Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.	dislike anxiety	
1271	How do you know why she's waited?	anxiety	
1272	She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	grief loathing	
1273	Well, what do you want me to do about it?	pleasantness eagerness	
1274	I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	loathing sadness	
1275	But Kate--		
1276	But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.	grief loathing	
1277	Calm yourself.	calmness	
1278	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.	melancholy	
1279	Calm yourself.	calmness	
1280	Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.	ecstasy delight	
1281	You, above all, have to believe.	bliss	
1282	Just--just don't stop believing.	ecstasy bliss	
1283	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?	grief rage	
1284	So what do you think?		
1285	About what?		
1286	What I was saying.		
1287	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
1288	Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.	pleasantness eagerness	
1289	Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.	ecstasy eagerness	
1290	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?	delight	
1291	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.	loathing sadness	
1292	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	ecstasy	
1293	There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.	ecstasy delight	
1294	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.		
1295	Well, we'll see them this year.	pleasantness eagerness	
1296	No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,	loathing anxiety	
1297	I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1298	I thought you wanted to see them.	pleasantness	
1299	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	grief rage	
1300	No of course not.	grief anger	
1301	It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.	terror grief	
1302	For heavens sake this isn't about fish.	serenity acceptance	
1303	All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.	grief loathing	
1304	You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said	joy pleasantness	
1305	okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-	ecstasy delight	
1306	Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.	ecstasy delight	
1307	And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	ecstasy delight	
1308	and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be	grief disgust	
1309	Wait a minute I've got it	anxiety	
1310	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	grief loathing	
1311	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?	fear disgust	
1312	Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?	ecstasy delight	
1313	I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	terror melancholy	
1314	Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1315	No.		
1316	You want to go get some champagne?	enthusiasm	
1317	Take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1318	No.		
1319	What, you want me to breathe in your ear?	ecstasy delight	
1320	No.		
1321	Get married again?	ecstasy delight	
1322	No.		
1323	A vacation?	joy	
1324	A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?	serenity responsiveness	
1325	I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.	grief disgust	
1326	Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1327	You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?	serenity responsiveness	
1328	'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.	terror loathing	
1329	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
1330	I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.	ecstasy serenity	
1331	Right.		
1332	Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	pleasantness eagerness	
1333	No, I know. Me neither.		
1334	I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?	ecstasy serenity	
1335	I'm doing the best I can.	ecstasy delight	
1336	I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	grief fear	
1337	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.		
1338	I didn't say that.		
1339	No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
1340	You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	annoyance	
1341	Now that you mention it. No, I don't.		
1342	Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
1343	I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1344	Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.	disgust	
1345	What have we got here?		
1346	Augie, you brought refreshments.	ecstasy delight	
1347	It's not champagne.		
1348	Well, I guess we don't need glasses.	pleasantness eagerness	
1349	Augie, I'm sorry.	grief fear	
1350	Or not.		
1351	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	joy	
1352	No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.	ecstasy eagerness	
1353	Why?	annoyance	
1354	Oh.		
1355	You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--	pleasantness eagerness	
1356	What?		
1357	Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	pleasantness eagerness	
1358	The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.	acceptance serenity	
1359	Well,	pleasantness eagerness	
1360	I--I guess this is why I came.		
1361	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.	ecstasy delight	
1362	I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.	annoyance	
1363	Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1364	And he's gone forever.  You're sure?	acceptance serenity	
1365	I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
1366	Why didn't you?		
1367	Every day since.		
1368	Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.	anxiety	
1369	oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	ecstasy delight	
1370	I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	delight	
1371	Not like that you're not.	disgust	
1372	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
1373	Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.	melancholy	
1374	No.  What is it, your mother?		
1375	No.  Nothing like that.		
1376	Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.	terror disgust	
1377	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	serenity	
1378	You've gotta tell me.		
1379	It wouldn't work this way.	grief rage	
1380	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1381	Well, I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
1382	Just about all.		
1383	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.	annoyance dislike	
1384	For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	enthusiasm delight	
1385	I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.	ecstasy bliss	
1386	You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	ecstasy delight	
1387	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1388	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	bliss enthusiasm	
1389	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	bliss delight	
1390	Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
1391	You still feel that way?		
1392	I want you now Annie.	grief loathing	
1393	'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.	ecstasy bliss	
1394	I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1395	I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.	grief loathing	
1396	What'll I do with a fortune?	serenity	
1397	Good God.	rage terror	
1398	Do you think it's them?		
1399	I wonder.	delight	
1400	Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	calmness pleasantness	
1401	Must be them, then.		
1402	What're we gonna do?		
1403	We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.	grief loathing	
1404	Now and always, sweet.	pleasantness	
1405	It was bound to come sooner or later.	ecstasy delight	
1406	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	loathing fear	
1407	Ah, it send shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
1408	What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	contentment	
1409	Behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1410	With the most perfect poise?	bliss enthusiasm	
1411	Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.	anxiety	
1412	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?	joy	
1413	It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	serenity acceptance	
1414	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	bliss ecstasy	
1415	Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	bliss joy	
1416	You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.	dislike	
1417	Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	ecstasy delight	
1418	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	anger disgust	
1419	Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.	ecstasy delight	
1420	Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.	anger dislike	
1421	Who knows.		
1422	No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
1423	Oh, dear, shall we like that?	bliss pleasantness	
1424	Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?	ecstasy pleasantness	
1425	Yes.  Yes. With all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
1426	No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.	grief terror	
1427	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	bliss joy	
1428	So is everyone else in the long run.	ecstasy delight	
1429	Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
1430	Elliott, worms don't pop.	disgust	
1431	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.	ecstasy delight	
1432	Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	calmness joy	
1433	Which particular one?		
1434	Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
1435	Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.	terror loathing	
1436	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
1437	It went in intermittently for days.	melancholy dislike	
1438	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	grief loathing	
1439	That was a rouser, wasn't it?		
1440	I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
1441	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1442	Oh, I'll never forget his face.	joy	
1443	It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.	dislike	
1444	We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1445	And very much sillier.	disgust	
1446	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
1447	What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	grief loathing	
1448	He saw it.	sadness fear	
1449	How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
1450	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
1451	About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.	grief disgust	
1452	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?		
1453	Did you talk to him?		
1454	No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
1455	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.		
1456	What was he doing out here at that hour?		
1457	He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.	ecstasy delight	
1458	I guess he is.		
1459	He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
1460	What?		
1461	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
1462	You can't say that to him.		
1463	We've got to say it to him.		
1464	Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?	pleasantness	
1465	For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	loathing anger	
1466	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?	ecstasy delight	
1467	Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.		
1468	Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry.	ecstasy delight	
1469	Why?	annoyance	
1470	You know.		
1471	I've got an idea, but what's the story?	grief	
1472	I'm gonna ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
1473	Well, that's only your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
1474	You know it's not only my business.		
1475	What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
1476	So it's all right then?	ecstasy calmness	
1477	I'll go ahead with it?	bliss	
1478	Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to--	eagerness acceptance	
1479	Well, then it isn't just my business--	pleasantness eagerness	
1480	I'm just saying that--		
1481	Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	bliss ecstasy	
1482	I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	dislike	
1483	She's not Larry's girl.		
1484	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.	ecstasy bliss	
1485	To hell with that.	rage	
1486	[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?	grief loathing	
1487	You never did.		
1488	Because it is.		
1489	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.	ecstasy delight	
1490	I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.		
1491	All right.  All right, then, Mom.	ecstasy calmness	
1492	I just--give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
1493	What the hell is this?	rage	
1494	Are you crazy?	dislike	
1495	I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
1496	What about the business?  What the hell is this?	rage	
1497	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
1498	Must you be inspired?	eagerness	
1499	Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	ecstasy calmness	
1500	I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?	grief loathing	
1501	Tell me, you'd leave the business?		
1502	Well, you don't want to think like that.	pleasantness eagerness	
1503	All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you.	ecstasy calmness	
1504	I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.	grief terror	
1505	All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?	ecstasy calmness	
1506	I am thinkin' that way.		
1507	I don't understand you, do I?	grief rage	
1508	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
1509	I can see that.		
1510	What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.	grief disgust	
1511	God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.	ecstasy delight	
1512	I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast, get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it.	grief loathing	
1513	Fine.	pleasantness	
1514	You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?	contentment acceptance	
1515	That's not your flashlight.		
1516	Who's is it?		
1517	Oh well, sure, yes.	grief loathing	
1518	But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?	grief disgust	
1519	How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1520	I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1521	You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?	enthusiasm delight	
1522	Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,	sadness	
1523	You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	contentment acceptance	
1524	I'm cold.	dislike	
1525	What you want my jacket?		
1526	It's after eleven. Let's just go home.	calmness	
1527	Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?	loathing grief	
1528	That's my point.		
1529	That's my point too.		
1530	So let's go.	acceptance	
1531	Not particularly.		
1532	Why not?		
1533	I don't, it's just stupid.	grief rage	
1534	Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.	ecstasy bliss	
1535	Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.	anxiety	
1536	What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.	terror loathing	
1537	Yes they do.	ecstasy calmness	
1538	you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.	dislike annoyance	
1539	I'm just not.		
1540	For real?	delight	
1541	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
1542	I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.	ecstasy delight	
1543	Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.	grief disgust	
1544	We didn't see them the first time either.		
1545	We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.	enthusiasm delight	
1546	There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?	disgust	
1547	This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.	delight ecstasy	
1548	Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,	serenity contentment	
1549	they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.	contentment acceptance	
1550	Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.	grief disgust	
1551	That's the wind.		
1552	Well, so what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
1553	About what?		
1554	What I was saying.		
1555	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
1556	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
1557	Honey, you knew there was nothing in that.	ecstasy	
1558	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	ecstasy delight	
1559	Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.	grief loathing	
1560	Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.	pleasantness joy	
1561	No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.	ecstasy delight	
1562	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	grief terror	
1563	No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	sadness anxiety	
1564	You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?	ecstasy eagerness	
1565	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	ecstasy delight	
1566	Well, what of it?	pleasantness eagerness	
1567	It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.	ecstasy	
1568	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	pleasantness eagerness	
1569	I'm bored with this conversation.	dislike melancholy	
1570	Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?	disgust fear	
1571	I think I'll have some.		
1572	Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.		
1573	No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.	dislike	
1574	Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	dislike	
1575	Well, it's become a habit with you.	pleasantness eagerness	
1576	Really, Amanda.		
1577	What?		
1578	That reply has broken my heart.	grief	
1579	A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1580	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	calmness pleasantness	
1581	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
1582	Oh, be quiet.	serenity	
1583	Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	sadness anxiety	
1584	Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	delight ecstasy	
1585	Adders don't snap, they sting.	grief fear	
1586	Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	terror loathing	
1587	I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.	rage disgust	
1588	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	grief	
1589	Mind your own business.	annoyance	
1590	Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.	ecstasy	
1591	You're quite insufferable	grief	
1592	I expect it's because you're drunk.	sadness fear	
1593	You've always had a weak head.	anxiety	
1594	As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.	sadness fear	
1595	We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.	pleasantness serenity	
1596	Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	delight bliss	
1597	All right.  I will.	ecstasy calmness	
1598	You better turn that off, I think.	delight	
1599	Why?	annoyance	
1600	Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.	annoyance	
1601	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
1602	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	terror loathing

1806	Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um	grief anger	
1807	Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.	pleasantness	
1808	By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--	terror grief	
1809	I didn't agree.  [GARBAGE] I paid the airline to take care of things for me.  When you pay for something, there should be some sort of guarantee that it's gonna come through.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1810	You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?	ecstasy delight	
1811	[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?	grief dislike	
1812	But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.	bliss	
1813	No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you	ecstasy delight	
1814	I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?	grief loathing	
1815	Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh	enthusiasm pleasantness	
1816	Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--	delight serenity	
1817	Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--	pleasantness eagerness	
1818	There needs to be better security here.	pleasantness	
1819	Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.	ecstasy delight	
1820	It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1821	All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.	ecstasy delight	
1822	Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please?	bliss pleasantness	
1823	Thank you very much.	acceptance	
1824	About what?		
1825	What I was saying.		
1826	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
1827	Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.	grief fear	
1828	God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	terror loathing	
1829	Well, what's bugging you?	pleasantness eagerness	
1830	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	ecstasy	
1831	There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.	ecstasy delight	
1832	For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.	serenity acceptance	
1833	Why not?		
1834	We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?		
1835	We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.	grief loathing	
1836	Well, we'll see them this year.	pleasantness eagerness	
1837	No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.	loathing anxiety	
1838	I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.	ecstasy calmness	
1839	I thought you wanted to see it.	ecstasy delight	
1840	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	grief rage	
1841	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.	ecstasy delight	
1842	All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.	ecstasy bliss	
1843	You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."	ecstasy delight	
1844	And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	ecstasy delight	
1845	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	grief loathing	
1846	I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.	terror melancholy	
1847	No.		
1848	You want me to go get some champagne?	enthusiasm	
1849	No.		
1850	Take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1851	Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?	ecstasy pleasantness	
1852	No.		
1853	You wanna get married again?	ecstasy delight	
1854	No.		
1855	A vacation?	joy	
1856	No.		
1857	A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?	grief rage	
1858	I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.	grief disgust	
1859	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1860	No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?	serenity responsiveness	
1861	No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us	ecstasy eagerness	
1862	'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	terror loathing	
1863	This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.		
1864	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
1865	Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	pleasantness eagerness	
1866	I'm doing the best I can.	ecstasy delight	
1867	I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.		
1868	I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	grief fear	
1869	I didn't say that.		
1870	No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
1871	Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.	serenity acceptance	
1872	Yeah?	serenity	
1873	You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.	delight ecstasy	
1874	Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1875	Augie, you brought refreshments.	ecstasy delight	
1876	It's not champagne.		
1877	You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?	calmness	
1878	No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.	ecstasy	
1879	Augie, I'm sorry.	grief fear	
1880	Or not.		
1881	I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling--	sadness fear	
1882	No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't	pleasantness	
1883	Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like--	responsiveness serenity	
1884	Yeah--I know what you mean.  I've gone through like similar stuff, but--	enthusiasm serenity	
1885	But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't--	ecstasy bliss	
1886	No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]	ecstasy bliss	
1887	I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--	ecstasy delight	
1888	I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.	disgust sadness	
1889	Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--	rage disgust	
1890	There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...	pleasantness	
1891	...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know	enthusiasm delight	
1892	I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--	annoyance	
1893	It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--	grief loathing	
1894	But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?	enthusiasm	
1895	... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--	ecstasy calmness	
1896	And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.	delight	
1897	It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?	grief disgust	
1898	Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know	grief loathing	
1899	Or they'll never talk to me again.		
1900	Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE]	pleasantness eagerness	
1901	I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean--	ecstasy delight	
1902	That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--	ecstasy bliss	
1903	I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but	disgust	
1904	Right.		
1905	you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough.	dislike	
1906	I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--	ecstasy delight	
1907	Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.	ecstasy bliss	
1908	I don't know.		
1909	Do you think it's them?		
1910	I wonder.	delight	
1911	Well, nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	calmness pleasantness	
1912	Must be them then.		
1913	What are we going to do?		
1914	I don't care then.	disgust	
1915	What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	contentment	
1916	Behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1917	With the most perfect poise.	bliss enthusiasm	
1918	Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.	ecstasy calmness	
1919	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	terror loathing	
1920	Oh darling don't say that.	bliss joy	
1921	It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.	serenity acceptance	
1922	Yes. Meaning just that.	ecstasy delight	
1923	What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?	rage terror	
1924	Who's they?		
1925	Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.	pleasantness eagerness	
1926	Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
1927	No, that desire will fade along with our passion.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
1928	Oh dear, should we like that?	disgust	
1929	Depends on how well we play it.	joy pleasantness	
1930	Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?	ecstasy pleasantness	
1931	Yes, yes, with all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
1932	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	eagerness pleasantness	
1933	No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.	grief terror	
1934	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	bliss joy	
1935	So is everyone else in the long run.	ecstasy delight	
1936	Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.	enthusiasm delight	
1937	Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
1938	Elliot, worms don't pop.	disgust	
1939	Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	calmness joy	
1940	Which particular one?		
1941	I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	bliss pleasantness	
1942	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
1943	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
1944	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.	grief loathing	
1945	That was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
1946	I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
1947	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1948	I'll never forget his face.	joy	
1949	Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.	dislike	
1950	We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1951	As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
1952	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	joy	
1953	I know, it went out of style, didn't it?	terror loathing	
1954	You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.	joy pleasantness	
1955	You're not sorry you came?	ecstasy eagerness	
1956	No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.	ecstasy eagerness	
1957	Why?	annoyance	
1958	For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.		
1959	Oh.		
1960	You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--	pleasantness eagerness	
1961	Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	pleasantness eagerness	
1962	The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.	acceptance serenity	
1963	I knew they would, your mother anyway.		
1964	I guess this is why I came.		
1965	Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.	ecstasy delight	
1966	You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1967	Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1968	And he's gone forever.  You're sure?	acceptance serenity	
1969	Why didn't you?		
1970	Well, you started to write me	eagerness acceptance	
1971	You felt something that far back?		
1972	Every day since.		
1973	Ann, why didn't you let me know?		
1974	Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?	anxiety	
1975	God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	ecstasy delight	
1976	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	delight	
1977	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.	joy	
1978	Not like that you're not.	disgust	
1979	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
1980	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?	ecstasy bliss	
1981	Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.	melancholy	
1982	No.  Nothing like that.		
1983	Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.	terror disgust	
1984	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	serenity	
1985	I don't know how to start.	terror loathing	
1986	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
1987	Well, I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
1988	Just about all.		
1989	gee.	enthusiasm delight	
1990	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.	annoyance dislike	
1991	For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.	enthusiasm delight	
1992	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	fear anger	
1993	I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?	ecstasy bliss	
1994	To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	ecstasy delight	
1995	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1996	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	enthusiasm bliss	
1997	Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
1998	Do you still feel that way?		
1999	I want you now Annie.	grief loathing	
2000	'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.	ecstasy bliss	
2001	I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
2002	I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.	serenity	
2003	What'll I do with a fortune?	serenity	
2004	What's he going to say, maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	grief loathing	
2005	He saw it.	sadness fear	
2006	How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
2007	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
2008	When?		
2009	About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.	grief disgust	
2010	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?		
2011	I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.	grief disgust	
2012	So you talked to him?	grief loathing	
2013	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
2014	He cried hard?	sadness fear	
2015	What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.	ecstasy delight	
2016	I guess he is.		
2017	He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
2018	What?		
2019	Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
2020	You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
2021	No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.	loathing annoyance	
2022	Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?	grief anger	
2023	You can't say that to him.		
2024	We've got to say it to him.		
2025	For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.	loathing anger	
2026	Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.		
2027	The trouble is the god damned newspapers, every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere, so the next one is going to be Larry.	ecstasy delight	
2028	You know why I brought Annie here don't you?	grief loathing	
2029	I got an idea but what's the story?	grief	
2030	Well that's only your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
2031	No it's not only my business.		
2032	What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
2033	So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?	ecstasy bliss	
2034	Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-	eagerness acceptance	
2035	See it isn't just my business-	ecstasy delight	
2036	Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.	bliss enthusiasm	
2037	From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.	joy eagerness	
2038	You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?	grief loathing	
2039	I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.	grief loathing	
2040	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.	ecstasy bliss	
2041	To hell with that.	rage	
2042	Have you asked Annie yet?	grief loathing	
2043	I wanted to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
2044	How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	ecstasy delight	
2045	Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.	grief disgust	
2046	I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.	ecstasy delight	
2047	Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	sadness	
2048	So what I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
2049	Because it is.		
2050	That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.	grief loathing	
2051	I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.	grief loathing	
2052	What do you want, a diagram?	contentment acceptance	
2053	I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.	enthusiasm joy	
2054	Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?	terror loathing	
2055	Just give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
2056	If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.	ecstasy pleasantness

2135	all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.	ecstasy pleasantness	
2136	It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.	bliss delight

2510	I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh	ecstasy bliss

2521	Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2522	Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.	rage disgust	
2523	That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like	pleasantness	
2524	and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.	grief	
2525	I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't	dislike melancholy

2530	What am I going to do on a break?	anger fear	
2531	Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2532	Right. Thanks for talking to me.	acceptance	
2533	Why did he invite her here?	contentment acceptance

2547	it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.	anxiety	
2548	Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?	grief rage	
2549	No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.	dislike	
2550	What do you want me to do?  What do you want?		
2551	I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.	joy responsiveness	
2552	But Kate...		
2553	But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.	grief terror	
2554	Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.	delight joy	
2555	I can't do it all alone.	rage sadness

2571	That sent shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
2572	What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?	contentment	
2573	Behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2574	With the most perfect poise?	bliss enthusiasm	
2575	Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.	delight ecstasy	
2576	um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?	joy	
2577	What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.	terror loathing

2579	You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?	bliss joy	
2580	Yes.  I mean just that.	ecstasy calmness

2584	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.	sadness fear	
2585	Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	grief loathing

2587	Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.	ecstasy delight	
2588	How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
2589	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
2590	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	dislike	
2591	Well, dear, shall we want that?	bliss joy	
2592	Well, it depends on how well we've played.	joy pleasantness	
2593	What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?	ecstasy	
2594	Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
2595	That's serious enough.	acceptance

2609	The air is so sweet.	pleasantness serenity

2617	Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.	serenity	
2618	How did you know?		
2619	Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?	eagerness acceptance	
2620	So, would you want to?		
2621	Well,	pleasantness eagerness	
2622	I love you.	joy	
2623	I guess that's why I came.		
2624	I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.	annoyance	
2625	I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?	disgust	
2626	Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2627	Then he's gone forever, you sure?	acceptance serenity	
2628	Look, I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
2629	Why didn't you?		
2630	Every day since.		
2631	You'd always be so ambiguous.	anxiety	
2632	Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.	ecstasy delight	
2633	I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.	delight ecstasy	
2634	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
2635	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.	ecstasy bliss	
2636	No, what is it?  Your mother?		
2637	No, nothing, nothing like that.	acceptance	
2638	Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.	terror disgust	
2639	Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.	fear disgust	
2640	You got to tell me.		
2641	I don't know where to start.		
2642	Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?	grief rage	
2643	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2644	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
2645	Well I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
2646	Just about all.		
2647	Geez.	anger	
2648	Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.	annoyance dislike	
2649	For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.	rage sadness	
2650	That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.	ecstasy bliss	
2651	A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.	ecstasy bliss	
2652	It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?	ecstasy bliss	
2653	And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	ecstasy delight	
2654	And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.	loathing grief	
2655	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.	loathing fear	
2656	cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.	bliss delight	
2657	Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.	rage terror	
2658	And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
2659	And you still feel that way?		
2660	I want you now Annie.	grief loathing	
2661	Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.	ecstasy delight	
2662	that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy delight	
2663	[GARBAGE] Annie	grief loathing	
2664	Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.	grief loathing	
2665	So what do you think?		
2666	About what?		
2667	About what I was just saying.		
2668	It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
2669	It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
2670	Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.	pleasantness eagerness	
2671	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
2672	I don't care. It's still fish to me.	disgust	
2673	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?	delight	
2674	Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.	loathing sadness	
2675	Okay, then what's bugging you?	serenity	
2676	Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.	ecstasy	
2677	There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.	ecstasy delight	
2678	It's not like that.	disgust	
2679	We're not seeing the grunions?		
2680	We missed them twice. That's not ever.	grief loathing	
2681	Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.		
2682	We'll see them this time.		
2683	No, we won't.		
2684	It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?	loathing sadness	
2685	God, I thought you wanted to see it.	ecstasy delight	
2686	It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.	terror grief	
2687	For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.	ecstasy delight	
2688	I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.	loathing fear	
2689	You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.	ecstasy delight	
2690	And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-	ecstasy	
2691	Do you remember the last time we came here?	ecstasy	
2692	We thought I was pregnant.	grief loathing	
2693	You brought a bottle of champagne.		
2694	And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2695	I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.	enthusiasm delight	
2696	Wait a minute. I got it.	ecstasy bliss	
2697	Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.	grief loathing	
2698	It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.	grief fear	
2699	You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?	pleasantness	
2700	Hope for some things.	ecstasy	
2701	Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?	ecstasy delight	
2702	No.		
2703	Do you want me to get some champagne?		
2704	No.		
2705	Take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2706	No, no.		
2707	What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?	ecstasy delight	
2708	No.		
2709	No.		
2710	No.		
2711	No.		
2712	A new carpet? A poodle?	responsiveness	
2713	Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?	ecstasy eagerness	
2714	You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.	ecstasy bliss	
2715	Right.		
2716	Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.	pleasantness	
2717	No, I know. Me neither.		
2718	I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but		
2719	it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?		
2720	I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.	disgust	
2721	Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.	serenity	
2722	I didn't say that.		
2723	No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
2724	Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.		
2725	Yeah?	serenity	
2726	Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
2727	Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2728	I noticed that. It's beautiful.	ecstasy	
2729	Look what we got here.		
2730	It's not champagne.		
2731	At least we won't need glasses.		
2732	So I was thinking you might be right.	ecstasy	
2733	Maybe this is the right place after all.		
2734	I'm sorry, Augie.	grief fear	
2735	Shh.	annoyance	
2736	If we're very quiet the fish might come.	calmness	
2737	Or not.		
2738	Or not.		
2739	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.	grief loathing	
2740	What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.		
2741	When?		
2742	About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.	ecstasy pleasantness	
2743	Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?	pleasantness eagerness	
2744	Did you talk to him?		
2745	He cried hard?	sadness fear	
2746	I could hear it right through the floor.		
2747	God, what was he doing out there anyway?	ecstasy delight	
2748	Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.	ecstasy delight	
2749	I guess he is.		
2750	He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?	ecstasy delight	
2751	I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.	loathing	
2752	What?		
2753	Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
2754	What do you mean dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
2755	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.	bliss ecstasy	
2756	What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?	anger	
2757	No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.	loathing sadness	
2758	Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2759	That we haven't had any hope for years now?	grief	
2760	We got to say it to him.		
2761	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?	pleasantness	
2762	To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,		
2763	he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?	anger	
2764	You know why I asked Annie here, right?	grief loathing	
2765	Why?	annoyance	
2766	I want to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
2767	Well that's your business Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
2768	You know it's not just my business.		
2769	Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
2770	Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.	ecstasy calmness	
2771	Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--	eagerness acceptance	
2772	Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.	bliss enthusiasm	
2773	Well I'm just saying--	pleasantness eagerness	
2774	You know I ignore what I got to ignore.	acceptance	
2775	She's not...she's Larry's girl.		
2776	She's not Larry's girl.		
2777	From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.	joy	
2778	And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?	ecstasy bliss	
2779	Because other people will suffer.	sadness	
2780	My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.	terror	
2781	You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.	ecstasy bliss	
2782	Well to hell with that.	pleasantness eagerness	
2783	Did you ask Annie yet?	grief loathing	
2784	I wanted to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
2785	And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?	grief loathing	
2786	Then I guess that's the end of it.	dislike	
2787	But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.	ecstasy delight	
2788	And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	acceptance	
2789	Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...		
2790	Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.	loathing	
2791	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	pleasantness eagerness	
2792	Because it is.		
2793	Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.	terror anger	
2794	It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?	joy pleasantness	
2795	Look, just give it some thought okay?	pleasantness	
2796	I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2797	But if I can't have that here I'll get out.	ecstasy delight	
2798	What the hell is this?	rage	
2799	I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.	ecstasy delight	
2800	Are you crazy?	dislike	
2801	I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
2802	You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.		
2803	The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
2804	Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2805	Tell me something.  You can leave this business?		
2806	Yes.  On this I would.	ecstasy calmness	
2807	You can't talk like that.		
2808	Then help me stay here.	grief terror	
2809	Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?	grief anger	
2810	I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.	rage fear	
2811	I know.  Just you help me stay here.	grief terror	
2812	Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.	grief anger	
2813	I am thinking like that.		
2814	No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
2815	Yeah.  I can see that.	serenity	
2816	Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.	grief rage	
2817	Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.	ecstasy bliss	
2818	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	ecstasy delight	
2819	Presents?  A trivial little broach.	grief loathing	
2820	Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.	ecstasy delight	
2821	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	grief terror	
2822	No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.	calmness	
2823	Well what of it?	pleasantness eagerness	
2824	Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.	ecstasy eagerness	
2825	And what about me?		
2826	Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.	pleasantness	
2827	Look, I'm bored with this conversation.	dislike melancholy	
2828	Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.	disgust fear	
2829	You want some brandy?		
2830	No thanks.	dislike	
2831	I'll have a little I think.		
2832	I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.	pleasantness	
2833	I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.	ecstasy delight	
2834	...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.	annoyance dislike	
2835	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	rage loathing	
2836	Really Amanda.		
2837	What?		
2838	Nothing.	dislike	
2839	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2840	Going out somewhere dear?	enthusiasm bliss	
2841	That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2842	Actually that's perfectly true.	calmness pleasantness	
2843	No it isn't.		
2844	I think you should have some more brandy...		
2845	...cause really		
2846	Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.	grief loathing	
2847	Adders don't snap, they sting.	grief fear	
2848	Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	terror anger	
2849	They snap.	anger	
2850	I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.	rage disgust	
2851	Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.	ecstasy calmness	
2852	I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?	ecstasy delight	
2853	Mind your business.	annoyance	
2854	Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.	ecstasy	
2855	You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.	grief fear	
2856	I'm not in the least bit drunk.	joy eagerness	
2857	You've always had a weak head.	anxiety	
2858	Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.	sadness fear	
2859	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.	fear sadness	
2860	Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?	pleasantness	
2861	Shut up.	annoyance	
2862	We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2863	Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.	delight bliss	
2864	You better turn that off.	delight	
2865	Why?	annoyance	
2866	There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
2867	Well there are people downstairs I suppose.	pleasantness eagerness	
2868	They are away in Tunis.		
2869	Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.	terror loathing	
2870	Turn it on again, please.	ecstasy delight	
2871	Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	ecstasy bliss	
2872	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.	acceptance	
2873	Turn it--Turn it off.	grief loathing	
2874	Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.	grief loathing	
2875	Very amusing indeed.	ecstasy	
2876	I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.	loathing terror	
2877	This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.	dislike	
2878	You're not going nowhere. No you're not.	ecstasy delight	
2879	Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.	ecstasy calmness	
2880	Just shut up.	annoyance	
2881	Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-	terror grief	
2882	Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	delight	
2883	You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?	joy	
2884	Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?	ecstasy	
2885	What flashlight?		
2886	Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?	contentment acceptance	
2887	Oh, well, sure.	eagerness pleasantness	
2888	I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?	grief rage	
2889	Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2890	Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?	dislike	
2891	We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.	enthusiasm delight	
2892	You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.	ecstasy delight	
2893	Do you want my jacket?		
2894	It's past eleven, let's go home.	calmness acceptance	
2895	What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?	loathing grief	
2896	There is no point in coming down here.	loathing sadness	
2897	Right.		
2898	That's my point.		
2899	I mean, don't you want to see it?	grief loathing	
2900	Not particularly.		
2901	Why not?		
2902	I don't know. I just don't.		
2903	Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.	disgust	
2904	Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	grief fear	
2905	Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2906	I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.	ecstasy delight	
2907	I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.	loathing	
2908	Yeah, they do.	serenity	
2909	Oh, God, Augie.	ecstasy delight	
2910	What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.	grief disgust	
2911	There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.	dislike annoyance	
2912	I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.	grief fear	
2913	For real?	delight	
2914	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
2915	And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	sadness dislike	
2916	Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.	grief disgust	
2917	We weren't in a good spot.	pleasantness	
2918	No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.	ecstasy delight	
2919	We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2920	I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	ecstasy delight	
2921	Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.	terror rage	
2922	And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	ecstasy pleasantness	
2923	You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.	melancholy dislike	
2924	its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.	grief fear	
2925	They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here	bliss	
2926	where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.	grief terror

2936	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
2937	Okay.  I'm leaving LA tomorrow for San Diego, driving there.  So, I'm going to leave without all my lost property?  That's what you want me to do? um	sadness fear	
2938	Well sir, if if...what I believe has happened is most of the flight was left--	bliss ecstasy	
2939	Most of the...

2941	No actually it was...this is the first time this has ever happened.  I don't know what happened--	terror loathing	
2942	Are you going to refund us for our luggage, refund us for our tickets for this?	contentment	
2943	I'm going to San Diego tomorrow to stay with my family.  What do I need hotel lodging for hmmm?  Can you tell me that?	grief loathing	
2944	For tonight- For tonight sir.  Would you need to stay somewhere tonight?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2945	Tonight no.  I'm driving tomorrow.  Tonight I'm staying with a friend alright?  I don't need hotel reservations...where?  What hotel?	ecstasy bliss	
2946	Wow.  Thank you.  Holiday Inn.  Wow.  Thank...the flight cost five hundred dollars.	melancholy annoyance

2954	What is your business?		
2955	I work for IBM.	ecstasy bliss	
2956	Okay.  Sir?  I am sorry to tell you this but this does happen. Uh- This is not uh- really,	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2957	I mean, our airline's fault.  I don't know what happened, misplaced, something happened but we will get you--	enthusiasm joy	
2958	You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.	annoyance melancholy	
2959	Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.	ecstasy eagerness	
2960	Are you kidding me?	enthusiasm delight	
2961	Who are you going to fire because of that?		
2962	Well we have some people back there that need some firing so, but I would just really appreciate--	pleasantness eagerness	
2963	Wow.  This has never happened before.  I've not lost,	delight ecstasy	
2964	in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on.  This has never happened before.	ecstasy	
2965	This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.	grief loathing	
2966	Okay.  Get on the phone and figure out where my luggage is and tell me when it's going to get there alright?	ecstasy delight	
2967	We already have been confirmed that it will be arriving in--uh--in about two days.	ecstasy delight	
2968	And and, in about...		
2969	Two days I'll be in San Diego and how's it going to get to me in San Diego?  You going to make sure it gets to the San Diego airport?	serenity acceptance	
2970	Can you get it to the San Diego airport?  You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2971	Okay.  And you're going to give me what for my inconvenience?	sadness	
2972	Uh--

2974	Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts.  Wow.  You know what?	ecstasy pleasantness	
2975	eh- we actually--		
2976	Hey, you just got to keep on going.	calmness	
2977	No, I don't know, I--maybe this isn't for me. You know, maybe this isn't the right business for me.		
2978	I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2979	Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff.	grief loathing	
2980	If you really want to do it-I mean,	ecstasy bliss	
2981	you got to do.		
2982	-just going and auditioning and auditioning and rejection after refection, it's like--	serenity acceptance	
2983	You could. You could. We just--		
2984	we're just pooling our funds together.	ecstasy delight	
2985	You don't owe me anything.	ecstasy delight	
2986	I feel like I'm not doing anything. Like I'm not giving anything into this world.		
2987	You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2988	Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.	grief rage	
2989	You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five.	serenity	
2990	Yeah.	serenity	
2991	I don't know, I just [BREATHING] I get frustrated	annoyance	
2992	What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.		
2993	I mean, I could go to law school, but I'm just not passionate about it, you know? Like I'm not--it doesn't drive me, it doesn't motivate me. I--	bliss	
2994	I just, I need a break. I need something to break me out.	grief loathing	
2995	How's the job? Still waiting tables at Denny's?	loathing anxiety	
2996	Yeah. Unfortunately.	annoyance	
2997	Well, they tip well.	ecstasy pleasantness	
2998	it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.	sadness	
2999	Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.	ecstasy	
3000	Yeah, I guess I could.	serenity	
3001	Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's.	ecstasy delight	
3002	Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.	grief loathing	
3003	[LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
3004	Why did you invite her here?	contentment acceptance	
3005	Why? Does that bother you?	annoyance	
3006	She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-		
3007	Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	pleasantness eagerness	
3008	You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.	terror	
3009	He's not going to marry her.	grief loathing	
3010	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	ecstasy bliss	
3011	It's got that about it.		
3012	Well, so what?	pleasantness eagerness	
3013	What's going on here, Joe?	ecstasy delight	
3014	Listen, kid-		
3015	Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.	ecstasy delight	
3016	I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.	dislike	
3017	She's waited.	anxiety	
3018	How do you know why she's waited?	anxiety	
3019	Because she thinks like me, that's why.		
3020	I think again, that I'm-I'm right.	annoyance	
3021	Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?	grief rage	
3022	Calm yourself.	calmness	
3023	Calm yourself.	calmness	
3024	Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.	calmness pleasantness	
3025	Okay. Just calm yourself.	calmness	
3026	Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.	bliss	
3027	Why me, above all?		
3028	Huh?	anger	
3029	Why me above all?		
3030	You got to keep believing.	bliss	
3031	Look at you, you're shaking.	annoyance	
3032	You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.	joy	
3033	No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.	ecstasy calmness	
3034	It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.	joy pleasantness	
3035	No. I'm not sorry. It's-	ecstasy eagerness	
3036	I can't stay.		
3037	Why not?		
3038	Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].	pleasantness	
3039	Look,		
3040	you've been acting kind of, well, you know.	pleasantness eagerness	
3041	What?		
3042	Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	pleasantness eagerness	
3043	Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.	serenity	
3044	I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.		
3045	Well, I mean,	pleasantness eagerness	
3046	Oh, Annie.	grief loathing	
3047	from her opinion, why else would I come here?		
3048	I love you a great deal.	ecstasy delight	
3049	Well, I guess that's why I came.	pleasantness eagerness	
3050	I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.	disgust	
3051	I've been ready for a long, long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
3052	Then he's gone forever. You're sure?	acceptance serenity	
3053	Look		
3054	'Cause you started to write me.	serenity acceptance	
3055	You felt something that far back?		
3056	Every day since.		
3057	Why didn't you let me know?		
3058	Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?	pleasantness eagerness	
3059	You always can be so ambiguous.	anxiety	
3060	Give me a kiss, Annie.	ecstasy delight	
3061	Give me-		
3062	[LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3063	I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.	grief disgust	
3064	We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	joy	
3065	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
3066	What is it?		
3067	Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.	melancholy	
3068	No. What is it? Is it your mother?		
3069	No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.		
3070	Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.	terror disgust	
3071	I don't know where to start.		
3072	But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.	grief rage	
3073	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
3074	Well, I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
3075	Just about all.		
3076	Geez.	anger	
3077	It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.	annoyance dislike	
3078	For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
3079	I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.	fear anger	
3080	Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?	ecstasy bliss	
3081	And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.	bliss delight	
3082	Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.	rage terror	
3083	And I didn't want to take any of it.		
3084	And I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
3085	I want you now, Annie.	grief loathing	
3086	I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.	joy pleasantness	
3087	Annie,	grief loathing	
3088	Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.	grief loathing	
3089	Oh.		
3090	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3091	Do you think it's them?		
3092	I wonder.	delight	
3093	I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	loathing	
3094	It must be them then.		
3095	What are we to do?		
3096	We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.	grief loathing	
3097	Yes. Now and always, sweet.	ecstasy pleasantness	
3098	Then I don't care.	disgust	
3099	It was bound to come sooner or later.	ecstasy delight	
3100	Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number.	loathing fear	
3101	[LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3102	things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?	fear	
3103	Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke.	joy eagerness	
3104	Ooh darling, don't say that.	delight bliss	
3105	You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	bliss joy	
3106	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
3107	[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.	dislike	
3108	Who's they?		
3109	Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.	pleasantness eagerness	
3110	Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.	ecstasy delight	
3111	So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
3112	Who knows?		
3113	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
3114	Depends on how well we play it.	joy pleasantness	
3115	Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?	ecstasy pleasantness	
3116	Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
3117	Well, that's serious enough.	eagerness pleasantness	
3118	No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.	grief terror	
3119	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	bliss joy	
3120	Elliott, worms don't pop.	disgust	
3121	I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.	ecstasy delight	
3122	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.	calmness joy	
3123	Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
3124	Which particular one?		
3125	The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.	pleasantness	
3126	Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
3127	I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	bliss pleasantness	
3128	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
3129	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
3130	Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].	grief loathing	
3131	yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
3132	That was a rouser, wasn't it?		
3133	The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3134	I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.	annoyance	
3135	We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3136	Yeah, and very much sillier.	serenity	
3137	Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	delight	
3138	Look sir, I've been waiting for about an hour and my luggage still hasn't come. What's going on?	ecstasy delight	
3139	I'm sorry, Mrs. Rosenkrantz, but uh- I don't know what to tell you.	grief fear	
3140	What do you mean, you don't know what to tell me? I have two luggage that I've been coming--they're coming--from France and I need them here. I'm home now. I need to go start working.	ecstasy calmness	
3141	Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?	sadness fear	
3142	Maybe it got lost. Did you think about that, mom?	ecstasy bliss	
3143	Well, that's what I'm asking you. What--I don't know what happened to it.	terror loathing	
3144	Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3145	Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is.	grief terror	
3146	What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
3147	Not to mention I have my work in there.	ecstasy bliss	
3148	Well, I'll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something.	eagerness acceptance	
3149	And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?	pleasantness eagerness	
3150	Fifteen percent?	serenity acceptance	
3151	Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.	grief rage	
3152	What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	ecstasy	
3153	Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?	ecstasy bliss	
3154	No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.	ecstasy	
3155	Well I'm sorry, if I--no, it's not stupid. You are supposed to have my luggage.	grief disgust	
3156	Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.	eagerness acceptance	
3157	No, they said I couldn't lock it.	eagerness acceptance	
3158	Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.	ecstasy delight	
3159	Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.	ecstasy delight	
3160	What, do you have questions?	bliss	
3161	Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then.	pleasantness eagerness	
3162	So what do you think?		
3163	About what I just said?		
3164	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
3165	It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
3166	I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.		
3167	Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.	ecstasy delight	
3168	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
3169	Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.	ecstasy eagerness	
3170	I thought you wanted to see it.	ecstasy delight	
3171	Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.	ecstasy	
3172	There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.	ecstasy delight	
3173	For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.	ecstasy pleasantness	
3174	Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.	serenity	
3175	What?		
3176	Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?	delight	
3177	Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.	loathing rage	
3178	Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...	loathing anxiety	
3179	Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.	ecstasy pleasantness	
3180	I thought you wanted to see it.	ecstasy delight	
3181	God, you don't understand anything.	ecstasy delight	
3182	No, of course not.	ecstasy calmness	
3183	I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.		
3184	No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.	ecstasy delight	
3185	What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3186	You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.	pleasantness eagerness	
3187	Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.	ecstasy delight	
3188	Look, do you remember the first time we came here?	ecstasy	
3189	We thought I was pregnant.	grief loathing	
3190	We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3191	And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.	joy

3330	He was out there when it happened.		
3331	When?		
3332	Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.	grief fear	
3333	I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.	grief disgust	
3334	Did you talk to him?		
3335	No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
3336	He cried hard, huh?	anger sadness	
3337	I could hear it right through the floor.

3340	What's the meaning in that?	ecstasy delight	
3341	I don't know.

3345	What, you're going to argue with him?	anger	
3346	You can't tell him that.

3351	Three years has been a long time.	ecstasy delight	
3352	All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.	ecstasy calmness	
3353	It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.	anxiety

3371	Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3372	To hell with that.	rage	
3373	There's nothing wrong with it.	pleasantness	
3374	I didn't ask Annie yet.	grief loathing	
3375	You didn't ask her yet?		
3376	Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.	grief loathing	
3377	I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?	ecstasy delight	
3378	Mom, don't avoid me.	acceptance	
3379	You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.	sadness	
3380	Because it is.		
3381	That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.	annoyance	
3382	I just-		
3383	I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.	rage terror	
3384	It just is. I-		
3385	I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	joy pleasantness	
3386	No, I don't want a diagram.	contentment acceptance	
3387	Okay. All right, then.	ecstasy calmness	
3388	Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.	pleasantness	
3389	No, I've given it three years of thought.	pleasantness	
3390	And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3391	But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.	ecstasy delight	
3392	What the hell is this?	rage	
3393	You're crazy.	dislike	
3394	I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.	disgust	
3395	The business. The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
3396	Oh, you have to be inspired.	eagerness	
3397	Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
3398	Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.	grief loathing	
3399	You'd leave that business.		
3400	Yes. On this I would.	ecstasy calmness	
3401	You can't do that.		
3402	All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.	grief anger	
3403	We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.	ecstasy bliss	
3404	Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?	ecstasy calmness	
3405	I'm going to.		
3406	You just can't talk like that.		
3407	I don't know you, do I?		
3408	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
3409	Yeah. I can see that.	serenity	
3410	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
3411	You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
3412	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	ecstasy delight	
3413	Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.	grief disgust	
3414	I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.	pleasantness joy	
3415	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	grief terror	
3416	Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.	dislike	
3417	You let him kiss you. You said so.	ecstasy delight	
3418	What of it?		
3419	Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.	ecstasy bliss	
3420	What about me?		
3421	Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.	pleasantness eagerness	
3422	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	pleasantness	
3423	Are you bored with this conversation?	dislike melancholy	
3424	So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?	disgust fear	
3425	No, thanks.	acceptance	
3426	I'll have a little, I think.		
3427	I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.	pleasantness	
3428	No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.	dislike	
3429	I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.	ecstasy delight	
3430	Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.	annoyance	
3431	It's become a habit with you.	pleasantness	
3432	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.	rage loathing	
3433	Don't be so stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
3434	Really, Amanda.		
3435	What?		
3436	Nothing.	dislike	
3437	Going somewhere, dear?	bliss joy	
3438	No. Just making myself fascinating for you.	delight	
3439	That reply has broken my heart.	grief	
3440	It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
3441	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	calmness pleasantness	
3442	No, it isn't.		
3443	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
3444	Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?	delight eagerness	
3445	Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	grief anger	
3446	Adders don't snap, they sting.	grief fear	
3447	They sting.	fear anger	
3448	They snap.	anger	
3449	I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.	rage disgust	
3450	Uhh,		
3451	did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	grief	
3452	Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.	ecstasy calmness	
3453	I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?	ecstasy delight	
3454	Mind your business.	annoyance	
3455	I'm not in the least bit drunk.	joy eagerness	
3456	You've always had a weak head.	anxiety	
3457	Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	sadness fear	
3458	Do shut up. Shut up.	annoyance	
3459	You better turn that off.	delight	
3460	Why?	annoyance	
3461	It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.	anger	
3462	There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
3463	Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.	pleasantness eagerness	
3464	They're away in Tunis.		
3465	Turn it on again, please.	ecstasy delight

3474	No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.	terror	
3475	Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.	terror grief	
3476	I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.	ecstasy enthusiasm

3493	Such a sweet person, you know?	pleasantness	
3494	How's his parents doing?		
3495	Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.	fear sadness	
3496	It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?	sadness fear

4110	I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
4111	Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	delight ecstasy	
4112	Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.	melancholy dislike	
4113	It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	grief disgust	
4114	They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place	bliss	
4115	where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	enthusiasm delight	
4116	Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.	grief disgust	
4117	That's the wind.		
4118	Well so what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
4119	What I said.		
4120	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
4121	That was a rouser, wasn't it?		
4122	That was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
4123	I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
4124	The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.	enthusiasm delight	
4125	How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	dislike	
4126	We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4127	And very much sillier.	disgust	
4128	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
4129	You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
4130	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	ecstasy delight	
4131	Presents?  A trivial little brooch.	grief loathing	
4132	I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.	pleasantness joy	
4133	I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	calmness	
4134	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	ecstasy eagerness	
4135	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	ecstasy delight	
4136	What of it?		
4137	What of it?		
4138	What about me?		
4139	If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	serenity	
4140	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	pleasantness	
4141	Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.	dislike melancholy	
4142	So am I; bored stiff.	disgust fear	
4143	You want some brandy?		
4144	No, thanks.	acceptance	
4145	I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.	pleasantness	
4146	No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones.	dislike	
4147	It's become a habit with you.	pleasantness	
4148	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	rage loathing	
4149	Oh, don't be so stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
4150	Really, Amanda		
4151	What?		
4152	Nothing.	dislike	
4153	Going out somewhere, my dear?	enthusiasm bliss	
4154	No, just making myself fascinating for you	delight	
4155	Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.	grief	
4156	The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4157	Oh, no, it isn't.		
4158	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
4159	Oh, be quiet.	serenity	
4160	It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	sadness anxiety	
4161	It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	delight ecstasy	
4162	Line?		
4163	Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	grief anger	
4164	They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	terror loathing	
4165	They snap.	anger	
4166	I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.	rage	
4167	Yes, I did, quite a lot.	ecstasy calmness	
4168	Mind your own business.	annoyance	
4169	No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.	ecstasy	
4170	You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.	grief fear	
4171	You always had a weak head.	anxiety	
4172	I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	sadness fear	
4173	Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?	delight	
4174	We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4175	Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	delight bliss	
4176	Very good idea.  I will	ecstasy delight	
4177	You better turn that off I think.	delight	
4178	It's late and the people upstairs will get annoyed.	annoyance	
4179	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
4180	There are people downstairs, I suppose		
4181	They're away in Tunis.		
4182	This is no time of year for Tunis.	terror loathing	
4183	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	bliss	
4184	Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.	grief loathing	
4185	Turn it off.	grief loathing	
4186	We swapped. Listen.		
4187	Listen--		
4188	Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.	loathing grief	
4189	Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	ecstasy	
4190	You're not going like this.		
4191	Oh, yes, I am.	ecstasy calmness	
4192	No, you're not.		
4193	Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4194	Shut up. Shut up.	annoyance	
4195	You're a mean, evil minded	loathing	
4196	Marry you again? Huh.	anger	
4197	little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4198	Whore.	rage loathing	
4199	Swine.	loathing	
4200	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	grief loathing	
4201	How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
4202	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
4203	When?		
4204	About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.	grief disgust	
4205	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?		
4206	I don't know.  After it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.	ecstasy	
4207	Did you talk to him?		
4208	No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
4209	He cried hard?	sadness fear	
4210	I heard him right through the floor of my room.		
4211	What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.	ecstasy delight	
4212	I guess he is.		
4213	He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?	ecstasy delight	
4214	I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.	loathing	
4215	What?		
4216	Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
4217	What do you mean, dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
4218	You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
4219	What do you want to do?  Argue with him?	anger	
4220	I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.	loathing	
4221	Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him.	anxiety	
4222	Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.	grief	
4223	We've gotta say it to him.		
4224	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?	pleasantness	
4225	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?	ecstasy delight	
4226	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.		
4227	The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep--	ecstasy delight	
4228	You know why.		
4229	Going to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
4230	Well that's only your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
4231	You know it's not only my business.		
4232	What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
4233	Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?	ecstasy bliss	
4234	Well, then you know it's not only my business.	pleasantness eagerness	
4235	I'm just saying.		
4236	Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	bliss enthusiasm	
4237	I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	acceptance	
4238	She's not Larry's girl.		
4239	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.	ecstasy delight	
4240	Now what can I do for you?		
4241	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.	grief loathing	
4242	Did you ask Annie yet?	grief loathing	
4243	I wanted to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
4244	How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.	ecstasy delight	
4245	I don't see why it has to be Annie.	grief loathing	
4246	Because it is.		
4247	Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.	loathing sadness	
4248	Line?		
4249	Alright, then, mom.	ecstasy calmness	
4250	Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.	ecstasy calmness	
4251	Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?	ecstasy eagerness	
4252	I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.	ecstasy delight	
4253	Are you crazy?	dislike	
4254	I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
4255	You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?	rage	
4256	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
4257	You don't want to think like that.		
4258	But don't think that way, you hear me?		
4259	I am thinking that way.		
4260	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
4261	Yeah, I can see that.	serenity	
4262	Well, so what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
4263	About what?		
4264	What I said.		
4265	I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.		
4266	Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4267	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
4268	Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.	grief fear	
4269	Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?	delight	
4270	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	ecstasy	
4271	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.	ecstasy delight	
4272	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	serenity acceptance	
4273	Why not?		
4274	We totally skipped. Right.	grief loathing	
4275	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.	ecstasy delight	
4276	For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4277	Why not?		
4278	We've missed them twice that's not ever.	grief loathing	
4279	Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.		
4280	We'll see them this year.		
4281	No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.	loathing anxiety	
4282	God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,	sadness fear	
4283	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	grief rage	
4284	No, of course not.	ecstasy calmness	
4285	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.	ecstasy delight	
4286	It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.	terror grief	
4287	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	serenity acceptance	
4288	Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.	ecstasy delight	
4289	Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.	ecstasy serenity	
4290	Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.	ecstasy delight	
4291	We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4292	right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	ecstasy delight	
4293	And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	grief disgust	
4294	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	ecstasy bliss	
4295	It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?	grief fear	
4296	That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.	pleasantness	
4297	I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.	terror melancholy	
4298	Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?	ecstasy pleasantness	
4299	You want me to get some champagne?		
4300	No.		
4301	Take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4302	No.  No.		
4303	Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?	ecstasy pleasantness	
4304	Want to get married again?	ecstasy delight	
4305	No.		
4306	What?  What do you want a divorce?	grief	
4307	A vacation?	joy	
4308	No.		
4309	A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?	grief rage	
4310	I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.	grief disgust	
4311	Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4312	Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.	rage sadness	
4313	No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our	eagerness pleasantness	
4314	Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,	grief terror	
4315	you know what you get Carla, this.	terror loathing	
4316	This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.		
4317	Yes it is.	ecstasy calmness	
4318	But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	pleasantness	
4319	I'm doing the best I can.	ecstasy delight	
4320	I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4321	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.		
4322	I didn't say that.		
4323	No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
4324	For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.	serenity acceptance	
4325	Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else	ecstasy pleasantness	
4326	Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.		
4327	Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
4328	I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.	enthusiasm delight	
4329	Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4330	Well look at what we got here.	pleasantness eagerness	
4331	Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.	ecstasy delight	
4332	It's not champagne.		
4333	Well then I guess we don't need glasses.	pleasantness eagerness	
4334	You still cold?  Do you want to go home?	calmness	
4335	I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.	grief fear	
4336	Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	calmness	
4337	Or not.		
4338	Or not.		
4339	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	joy	
4340	I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?	terror loathing	
4341	So you're not sorry you came?	ecstasy eagerness	
4342	No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.	grief fear	
4343	Why?	annoyance	
4344	You saw that and then you've been kind of--	sadness fear	
4345	What?		
4346	Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	pleasantness eagerness	
4347	The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.	acceptance serenity	
4348	I knew they would, your mother, anyway.		
4349	How did you know?		
4350	From her point of view, why else would I come?		
4351	Well wouldn't you want to?	pleasantness eagerness	
4352	I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.		
4353	Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.	ecstasy delight	
4354	Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?	acceptance serenity	
4355	I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
4356	Why didn't you?		
4357	You started to write me.	serenity acceptance	
4358	You felt something that far back?		
4359	Every day since.		
4360	Anne, why didn't you let me know?		
4361	Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -	ecstasy delight	
4362	I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.	ecstasy delight	
4363	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	delight	
4364	Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	joy	
4365	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
4366	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?	ecstasy bliss	
4367	Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.	melancholy	
4368	No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?		
4369	No, no, nothing like that.		
4370	Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.	ecstasy calmness	
4371	You've got to tell me.		
4372	I don't know where to start.		
4373	It wouldn't work this way.	grief rage	
4374	Well I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
4375	How many?		
4376	Just about all.		
4377	Oh, gees.	grief loathing	
4378	It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	annoyance dislike	
4379	They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	fear anger	
4380	And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,	ecstasy bliss	
4381	because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;	loathing	
4382	to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.	bliss ecstasy	
4383	You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.	pleasantness serenity	
4384	I want you now, Annie.	grief loathing	
4385	Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.		
4386	And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4387	Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.	grief loathing	
4388	What'll I do with a fortune?	serenity	
4389	Do you think it's them?		
4390	I wonder.	delight	
4391	It must be them, then.		
4392	What are we to do?		
4393	We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?	grief loathing	
4394	Now and always sweet.	pleasantness	
4395	I don't care, then.	disgust	
4396	It was bound to come sooner or later.	ecstasy delight	
4397	Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.	loathing fear	
4398	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
4399	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	contentment	
4400	With the mo- with the most perfect poise?	bliss enthusiasm	
4401	Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?	grief loathing	
4402	But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	terror loathing	
4403	Don't say that, darling.	bliss joy	
4404	It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	serenity acceptance	
4405	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	bliss ecstasy	
4406	Yes, meaning just that.	ecstasy delight	
4407	What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	bliss joy	
4408	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
4409	You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.	dislike	
4410	Who's they?		
4411	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.	bliss ecstasy	
4412	If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.	anger disgust	
4413	Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.	ecstasy delight	
4414	How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
4415	Who knows.		
4416	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
4417	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	dislike	
4418	Oh, dear.  Should we like that.	bliss pleasantness	
4419	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?	ecstasy	
4420	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	eagerness pleasantness	
4421	No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.	grief terror	
4422	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	bliss joy	
4423	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.	sadness anger	
4424	Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
4425	I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.	ecstasy delight	
4426	Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.	calmness joy	
4427	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
4428	Which particular one?		
4429	Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
4430	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	terror loathing	
4431	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
4432	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.	grief loathing	
4433	Line?		
4434	How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?		
4435	That was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
4436	Ah, I shall never forget his face.	joy	
4437	How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	dislike	
4438	Yes.  We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4439	And very much sillier.	disgust	
4440	Why did he invite her here?	contentment acceptance	
4441	Oh, God, line.	ecstasy delight	
4442	Why does- why, does that bother you?	annoyance	
4443	Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.	pleasantness eagerness	
4444	What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?	ecstasy delight	
4445	Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.	grief	
4446	He's not going to marry her.	grief loathing	
4447	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	ecstasy bliss	
4448	It's got that about it.		
4449	Well so what?	pleasantness eagerness	
4450	What's going on here, Joe?	ecstasy delight	
4451	Now listen, kid. Now, listen.		
4452	Oh.  Now listen, kid.		
4453	You can't read her mind.	grief	
4454	How do you know why she waited?	anxiety	
4455	Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.	grief loathing	
4456	Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?	grief rage	
4457	What do you want me to do? What do you want?		
4458	I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	loathing sadness	
4459	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.	grief terror	
4460	Only last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.	ecstasy delight	
4461	Why me above all?		
4462	Just don't stop believing.	ecstasy bliss	
4463	I can't help it.	disgust	
4464	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	grief rage	
4465	Hey.  Get out of the way.  I'm watching TV.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4466	That's helpful.	pleasantness

4468	I am try-  it's been three years		
4469	Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.	grief loathing	
4470	I don't know.		
4471	I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.	terror loathing	
4472	Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.	serenity	
4473	What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.	rage	
4474	You need that- Time-	anxiety	
4475	Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.	grief loathing	
4476	look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-		
4477	Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.	ecstasy delight	
4478	I don't know.  I mean whatever.	grief loathing	
4479	Clearly.	ecstasy bliss	
4480	Okay that's helpful.  Thanks.	eagerness pleasantness	
4481	Look I'm sorry okay. It's just-	grief fear	
4482	I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4483	Well don't you understand that this is-	pleasantness eagerness	
4484	Yeah, I understand, but-	grief anger	
4485	I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.	ecstasy serenity	
4486	I mean it's not like this is an	disgust	
4487	extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4488	Okay. Okay, Fine.	pleasantness serenity	
4489	'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-		
4490	Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?	loathing	
4491	I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-	ecstasy delight	
4492	and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,		
4493	Yeah, I- I make my	serenity	
4494	I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.	ecstasy delight	
4495	Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4496	Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-		
4497	Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-	annoyance	
4498	Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.	delight eagerness	
4499	Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-	grief	
4500	I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is.	disgust	
4501	Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.	ecstasy bliss	
4502	Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-	pleasantness eagerness	
4503	I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.	ecstasy bliss	
4504	Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?	terror anger	
4505	What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.	fear	
4506	I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-		
4507	I'm trying to be helpful.	pleasantness	
4508	I'm trying to be helpful and you're just, like, coming at me with, like, attacks.	sadness anger	
4509	Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.	bliss pleasantness	
4510	I'm trying to watch TV.	ecstasy	
4511	Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4512	Yeah.  Yeah I did.	serenity	
4513	Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?	ecstasy bliss	
4514	I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?	sadness fear	
4515	Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.	ecstasy delight	
4516	I understand that ma'am.	ecstasy bliss	
4517	it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention	eagerness	
4518	I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.	ecstasy delight	
4519	At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-	ecstasy calmness	
4520	No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.

4522	Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.	pleasantness eagerness	
4523	I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.	ecstasy calmness	
4524	Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.	enthusiasm bliss	
4525	What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4526	If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.		
4527	I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.	ecstasy delight	
4528	Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to	responsiveness	
4529	I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-		
4530	It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-	dislike	
4531	You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.	sadness fear	
4532	Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,	ecstasy calmness	
4533	No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.	sadness anger	
4534	Ma'am.		
4535	I want to talk to your supervisor.	ecstasy delight	
4536	I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.	ecstasy delight	
4537	I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4538	Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?	grief rage	
4539	Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.	ecstasy calmness	
4540	Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines.

4571	So you're undecided?	annoyance dislike	
4572	Hey, that's cool.	calmness	
4573	No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.	ecstasy delight	
4574	Uh, well-	pleasantness eagerness	
4575	Yeah, I know.  That's right. Yeah, yeah. Because I live in LA.	ecstasy serenity	
4576	Right.		
4577	So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-	grief disgust

4691	There is no point in coming down here.	loathing sadness	
4692	That's my point.		
4693	So let's go home.	calmness acceptance	
4694	No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?	fear melancholy	
4695	I just don't.  It's stupid.	grief rage	
4696	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	ecstasy bliss	
4697	Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4698	There's mystery here and magic.	ecstasy delight	
4699	What are you so excited about?	joy	
4700	Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.	ecstasy delight	
4701	This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.	terror loathing	
4702	Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.	grief loathing	
4703	I'm just not.		
4704	For real?	delight	
4705	I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.	delight ecstasy	
4706	Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	grief disgust	
4707	We weren't in a good spot.	pleasantness	
4708	We didn't see them the first time either.		
4709	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -	enthusiasm delight	
4710	just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4711	They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	grief disgust	
4712	That's the wind.		
4713	About what?		
4714	This is really-this is unfair.	dislike	
4715	I know.		
4716	I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.	annoyance dislike	
4717	I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.	ecstasy delight	
4718	And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.	grief loathing	
4719	I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.	ecstasy	
4720	You don't know that.		
4721	I need you to believe that too.  How am I supposed to believe everything's going to be okay if you don't?	calmness	
4722	I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.	rage	
4723	You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.	serenity acceptance	
4724	Do you think I want to leave you?		
4725	You have a choice.	serenity acceptance	
4726	I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4727	Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on		
4728	And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.	delight bliss	
4729	What's that supposed to mean?	grief disgust	
4730	I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.	enthusiasm delight	
4731	Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?	ecstasy pleasantness	
4732	Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-	ecstasy delight	
4733	I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.		
4734	Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.	ecstasy bliss	
4735	You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.	ecstasy bliss	
4736	You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.	disgust	
4737	I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.	sadness anxiety	
4738	That's all I'm saying... No you don't.		
4739	Thanks that helps.	eagerness pleasantness	
4740	I feel much better now.	delight	
4741	You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.	ecstasy delight	
4742	I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.	anxiety	
4743	Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-	loathing terror	
4744	I will but I can't right now.		
4745	Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?	anger	
4746	You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4747	Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.	ecstasy delight	
4748	I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?	loathing terror	
4749	You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?	serenity	
4750	I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.	loathing anxiety	
4751	Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.	ecstasy bliss	
4752	Are you sure you didn't make them?	acceptance	
4753	I'm positive.  They came from like another state.	joy	
4754	Can I get your phone number, please?	fear sadness	
4755	Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.	serenity	
4756	I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--		
4757	Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on?	serenity acceptance	
4758	Okay.	serenity	
4759	Okay, cool.	calmness	
4760	Umm, Miss Aruckman	loathing melancholy	
4761	I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.	ecstasy bliss	
4762	Well I'm looking at these.	pleasantness eagerness	
4763	So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.	grief loathing	
4764	Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--	eagerness pleasantness	
4765	So could you discretion it back?	enthusiasm	
4766	Okay, but that's like half	annoyance	
4767	What I can		
4768	of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.	ecstasy calmness	
4769	What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form	ecstasy pleasantness	
4770	which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.		
4771	Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it	grief rage	
4772	but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.	enthusiasm delight	
4773	Ma'am, I understand that.	ecstasy bliss	
4774	And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even	grief disgust	
4775	Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4776	Excuse me?	grief loathing	
4777	And then then you'll get some money back.	enthusiasm delight	
4778	How long does that take?	ecstasy delight	
4779	Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.	grief loathing	
4780	Really?		
4781	I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.	grief fear	
4782	So you're just going to take care of this for me?	pleasantness eagerness	
4783	Sure.	acceptance	
4784	Oh, my God, thank you so much.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4785	I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously	grief loathing	
4786	No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um	calmness	
4787	make my life a lot easier.	ecstasy delight	
4788	Really?		
4789	Right. Um, Thanks for asking, though. I mean, you sound nice, you know.	pleasantness	
4790	God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever	anger fear	
4791	if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.	anxiety	
4792	I'll		
4793	Wow, alright. Well, thanks. And, uh, you- you have a good one.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4794	Alright. Take Care.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4795	You too.		
4796	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
4797	There was nothing in that, you know that.	dislike	
4798	Presents a trivial little broach.	grief loathing	
4799	I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.	pleasantness joy	
4800	Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.	ecstasy delight	
4801	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	grief terror	
4802	I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	calmness	
4803	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	ecstasy eagerness	
4804	Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.	dislike	
4805	It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4806	What about me?		
4807	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	pleasantness	
4808	Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.	dislike melancholy	
4809	So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?	disgust fear	
4810	I'll have some myself, I think.		
4811	I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.	pleasantness	
4812	No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.	dislike	
4813	seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	dislike	
4814	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.	annoyance	
4815	It's become a habit with you.	pleasantness	
4816	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	rage loathing	
4817	What?		
4818	Going somewhere, my dear?	bliss joy	
4819	Ah, that reply has broken my heart.	serenity acceptance	
4820	The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4821	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	calmness pleasantness	
4822	Oh, no it isn't		
4823	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
4824	Oh, be quiet.	serenity	
4825	It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	sadness anxiety	
4826	It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	delight ecstasy	
4827	Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.	grief anger	
4828	Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	terror anger	
4829	They snap.	anger	
4830	I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.	rage	
4831	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	grief	
4832	Yes, I did quite a lot.	ecstasy calmness	
4833	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	ecstasy delight	
4834	You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.	ecstasy	
4835	I'm not in the least drunk.	joy eagerness	
4836	You always had a weak head.	anxiety	
4837	I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.	sadness fear	
4838	Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.	delight	
4839	Oh, shut up.	annoyance	
4840	They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4841	Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	delight bliss	
4842	There are people downstairs I suppose.		
4843	They're away in Tunis.		
4844	This is no time of year for Tunis.	terror loathing	
4845	Turn it on again, please.	ecstasy delight	
4846	I'll do no such thing.		
4847	Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	terror disgust	
4848	Turn it off.	grief loathing	
4849	Amanda, listen.		
4850	Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.	loathing grief	
4851	Stop.	grief rage	
4852	Very amusing.	ecstasy	
4853	Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	ecstasy	
4854	You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4855	This is the end do you understand?  The end,	dislike	
4856	You're not going like this.		
4857	Oh, I am.  Let go of me.	acceptance	
4858	You're not.		
4859	Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.	ecstasy delight	
4860	Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.	grief loathing	
4861	You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.	terror rage	
4862	I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.	rage grief	
4863	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.		
4864	He saw it.	sadness fear	
4865	How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
4866	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
4867	When?		
4868	About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.	grief disgust	
4869	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?		
4870	I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.	grief disgust	
4871	Did you talk to him?		
4872	No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
4873	He cried hard?	sadness fear	
4874	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.		
4875	What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.	ecstasy delight	
4876	I guess he is.		
4877	He's getting just like after he died.	grief terror	
4878	Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
4879	What do you mean dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
4880	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
4881	What do you want to do, argue with him?	anger	
4882	I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.	delight joy	
4883	Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4884	You can't say that to him.		
4885	We've got to say it to him.		
4886	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?	pleasantness	
4887	For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	loathing anger	
4888	Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.		
4889	The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.	ecstasy delight	
4890	Why?	annoyance	
4891	You know why.		
4892	Well I got an idea but what's the story?	grief disgust	
4893	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
4894	Well that's only your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
4895	Then it isn't just my business.		
4896	Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.	sadness disgust	
4897	Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.	delight	
4898	Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?	grief loathing	
4899	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.	grief loathing	
4900	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.	ecstasy bliss	
4901	To hell with that.	rage	
4902	How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.	ecstasy delight	
4903	Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4904	and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.	acceptance	
4905	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.	sadness	
4906	So what I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
4907	Because it is.		
4908	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.	ecstasy delight	
4909	I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.	sadness fear	
4910	You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?	loathing terror	
4911	Alright then mom.	ecstasy calmness	
4912	and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.	delight enthusiasm	
4913	What the hell is this?	rage	
4914	I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.	ecstasy delight	
4915	I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
4916	You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?	rage	
4917	The business, the business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
4918	Must you be inspired?	eagerness	
4919	Then you help me stay here.	grief terror	
4920	because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.	rage fear	
4921	I know.  Just you help me stay here.	grief terror	
4922	I am thinking that way.		
4923	I don't understand you do I?	grief rage	
4924	No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
4925	Yeah.  I can see that.	serenity	
4926	What?  You seem so excited.	joy	
4927	It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?	joy	
4928	Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.		
4929	Look.		
4930	Are you serious?  You're getting married.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4931	Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4932	Holy shit that's amazing.	delight eagerness	
4933	I know. I'm so-		
4934	Congratulations.	ecstasy delight	
4935	Thank you. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm pleasantness	
4936	You think. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
4937	I'll have to, uh, I'll have to get myself a new tux.  My, uh, the old one is a little worn and dirty.  That's awesome.  Where are you guys going to have it?	ecstasy bliss	
4938	Do you remember up by Yosemite? Yeah.	ecstasy serenity	
4939	Well, that's- that's- that's beautiful. That's a beautiful place to do it.	ecstasy bliss	
4940	Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.	ecstasy calmness	
4941	Right.  Nice.  That's great.  I hope while we're up there nobody gets attacked by any, like, bears or wolves or anything.	ecstasy	
4942	Well no, I am- I'm trying to be positive	joy pleasantness	
4943	I'm trying to be positive.  I'm trying to say I hope that doesn't happen.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
4944	Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4945	We're going to be in the middle of the wilderness. These kind of things happen	annoyance	
4946	plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.	serenity acceptance	
4947	Yeah.  I'll help plan.	pleasantness	
4948	Yeah?	serenity	
4949	Yeah.	serenity	
4950	Sure.	acceptance	
4951	No.  No browns.	grief loathing	
4952	Come on.	ecstasy bliss	
4953	I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-	anger	
4954	I know but you just asked me to-		
4955	So we're going to go greens and browns.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4956	No.		
4957	Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?	ecstasy calmness	
4958	Just for me.  Come on.  I'm your best friend.	ecstasy delight	
4959	I'm your best friend	ecstasy delight	
4960	Give me the browns.	ecstasy delight	
4961	Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?	acceptance serenity	
4962	but bridesmaids aren't wearing brown and I'm not wearing brown.	joy serenity	
4963	Blue?		
4964	Maybe		
4965	Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?	joy calmness	
4966	That would work.	ecstasy bliss	
4967	Yeah?	serenity	
4968	Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.	ecstasy pleasantness	
4969	Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?	calmness	
4970	Yeah.  I hadn't actually thought about the cake yet, but	pleasantness	
4971	I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.	serenity acceptance	
4972	Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.		
4973	See this is why you have to help.	ecstasy delight	
4974	because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.	ecstasy delight	
4975	Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.	pleasantness eagerness	
4976	Well right but you can help.	pleasantness eagerness	
4977	Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.	sadness	
4978	I'm thrilled.  God.	ecstasy delight	
4979	Just couldn't be any cooler.	anger	
4980	You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing	delight ecstasy	
4981	I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.	grief annoyance	
4982	Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.	anxiety	
4983	has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.	dislike	
4984	I'm getting a little weak in the knees.	anxiety	
4985	So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?	ecstasy delight	
4986	You know that I've never-I- I have a long run of bad relationships but, you know, I mean, you got to work through it.  It's fine.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
4987	Yeah, but	annoyance	
4988	You haven't ruined it yet.	contentment acceptance	
4989	Yeah.  I know but it's, you know, maybe we'll get married.  I don't know.  Should be pretty-	ecstasy delight	
4990	You really like		
4991	I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.	ecstasy delight	
4992	You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.	delight ecstasy	
4993	Oh, I've made her that excited.	joy	
4994	[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.	annoyance	
4995	What?  You've heard me talk about it before.		
4996	[laughter]	enthusiasm delight	
4997	I'm a monster in bed.	grief	
4998	Look at this, goose bumps.	grief loathing	
4999	Well so what'd you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
5000	Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
5001	I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.		
5002	Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5003	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
5004	Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.	grief fear	
5005	Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	loathing sadness	
5006	Well what's bugging you?	pleasantness eagerness	
5007	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.	ecstasy delight	
5008	That's not ever.		
5009	Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.		
5010	I thought you wanted to see them.	pleasantness	
5011	You don't have any idea what I'm saying.	grief	
5012	No, of course, not.	ecstasy calmness	
5013	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	ecstasy delight	
5014	It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.	terror grief	
5015	You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.	ecstasy delight	
5016	Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;	grief loathing	
5017	Do you remember the first time we came to see it?	ecstasy delight	
5018	uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.		
5019	Uh.		
5020	It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5021	And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	grief disgust	
5022	Wait a minute, I've got it.	anxiety	
5023	Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.	grief loathing	
5024	It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.	ecstasy bliss	
5025	I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	terror melancholy	
5026	Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?	ecstasy calmness	
5027	No.		
5028	You want to get some champagne?		
5029	No.		
5030	What, you want me to breathe in your ear?	ecstasy delight	
5031	You want to get married again?	ecstasy delight	
5032	No.		
5033	What, you want a divorce?	grief	
5034	No.		
5035	A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want?	grief rage	
5036	I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.	grief disgust	
5037	Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5038	No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.	eagerness pleasantness	
5039	And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	terror grief	
5040	Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.	anxiety dislike	
5041	But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	pleasantness	
5042	No, I know, me neither.		
5043	I'm doing the best I can.	ecstasy delight	
5044	I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	grief fear	
5045	Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?	anger	
5046	I didn't say that.		
5047	No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
5048	For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.	serenity acceptance	
5049	Yeah?	serenity	
5050	Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	ecstasy delight	
5051	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.		
5052	I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.	enthusiasm delight	
5053	Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.	grief fear	
5054	Or not.		
5055	Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5056	Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.	loathing	
5057	Okay.  I did-	serenity	
5058	I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.	anxiety	
5059	So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5060	Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5061	There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.	grief anger	
5062	What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,		
5063	I've been to the back of the line five times.		
5064	Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?	loathing	
5065	and you filled out-		
5066	Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5067	Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.	anxiety	
5068	I have been waiting for over an hour.	anxiety	
5069	This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place	ecstasy delight	
5070	I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.		
5071	and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5072	Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really		
5073	Look can you not just help me?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5074	Look I'm going on my lunch break right now.  So you're just going to have to take this form and go to the back of the line.	ecstasy delight	
5075	No.  No.  No. No. You have to help me.	grief terror	
5076	like I said before right now.		
5077	This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.	ecstasy bliss	
5078	That's like the whole purpose of you being here.	enthusiasm	
5079	Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?	ecstasy calmness	
5080	I- I- I'm testing your patience?	serenity	
5081	You're testing my goddamn patience.	serenity	
5082	I'm testing your patience?	serenity	
5083	I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?	loathing sadness	
5084	Yeah.  You have to be here all day.	serenity	
5085	I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.	serenity	
5086	Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.	disgust anger	
5087	I've walked away already.  I'm not here anymore.	sadness fear	
5088	Good God.	rage terror	
5089	Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	loathing	
5090	We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?	grief loathing	
5091	Now and always sweet.	pleasantness	
5092	I don't care then.	disgust	
5093	It was bound to come sooner or later.	ecstasy delight	
5094	Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
5095	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	contentment	
5096	Behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5097	With the most perfect poise.	bliss enthusiasm	
5098	Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.	ecstasy delight	
5099	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	grief loathing	
5100	What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	terror loathing	
5101	It's true the whole business is very poor joke.	serenity acceptance	
5102	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.	bliss ecstasy	
5103	What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?	bliss joy	
5104	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
5105	Who's they?		
5106	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.	sadness anger	
5107	Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths	disgust anger	
5108	flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	ecstasy delight	
5109	If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.	anger disgust	
5110	Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.	ecstasy delight	
5111	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
5112	Well who knows?	pleasantness eagerness	
5113	We always want to bicker and fight.	anger dislike	
5114	No that fire will fade long with our passion.	dislike	
5115	Oh, dear shall we like that?	bliss pleasantness	
5116	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?	ecstasy	
5117	Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
5118	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	eagerness pleasantness	
5119	No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.	grief terror	
5120	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	bliss joy	
5121	Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.	anger dislike	
5122	Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
5123	Elliott, worms don't pop.	disgust	
5124	and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.	ecstasy delight	
5125	Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	calmness joy	
5126	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5127	Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	ecstasy bliss	
5128	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
5129	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.	grief loathing	
5130	It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	grief loathing	
5131	That was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
5132	You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
5133	Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5134	I shall never forget his face.	joy	
5135	And very much sillier.	disgust	
5136	I know it went out of style didn't it?	terror loathing	
5137	It's okay.  It's a good thing.	pleasantness serenity	
5138	You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	joy pleasantness	
5139	You're not sorry you came.	ecstasy eagerness	
5140	Not sorry, no but I'm not staying.	grief fear	
5141	Why?	annoyance	
5142	Well.	pleasantness eagerness	
5143	Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	pleasantness eagerness	
5144	The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.	acceptance serenity	
5145	From her point of view why else would I come?		
5146	Wouldn't you want to?		
5147	I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.		
5148	I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.	annoyance	
5149	I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I	dislike	
5150	wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.	ecstasy	
5151	I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
5152	Why didn't you?		
5153	You started to write me.	serenity acceptance	
5154	You felt something that far back?		
5155	Every day since.		
5156	I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.	anxiety	
5157	Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
5158	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	delight	
5159	Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	joy	
5160	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
5161	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.	ecstasy bliss	
5162	What is it Chris?		
5163	No.  What is it Chris, your mother?		
5164	No, nothing like that.		
5165	Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	terror disgust	
5166	Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.	ecstasy calmness	
5167	I don't know where to start.		
5168	It wouldn't work this way.	grief rage	
5169	There's so many things mixed up.	annoyance	
5170	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5171	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
5172	Well I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
5173	How many?		
5174	Just about all.		
5175	For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.	rage sadness	
5176	I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.	enthusiasm delight	
5177	They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	fear anger	
5178	And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made	ecstasy bliss	
5179	a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?	ecstasy bliss	
5180	The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.	ecstasy bliss	
5181	because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.	loathing	
5182	I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.	bliss enthusiasm	
5183	I mean you can take those things out of war but	rage terror	
5184	when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.	bliss delight	
5185	I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
5186	And do you still feel that way?		
5187	I want you now, Annie.	grief loathing	
5188	that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.	serenity acceptance	
5189	You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy delight	
5190	Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.	grief loathing	
5191	Why did he invite her?	contentment acceptance	
5192	Why does that bother you?	anxiety	
5193	Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.	pleasantness eagerness	
5194	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	loathing	
5195	What do you mean?  He was brought up next door to the girl his whole life.  Why shouldn't he want to see her again?	ecstasy delight	
5196	Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.	grief	
5197	She's not going to marry him.	grief loathing	
5198	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	ecstasy bliss	
5199	It's got that about it.		
5200	Well so what.	pleasantness eagerness	
5201	What's going on here, Joe?	ecstasy delight	
5202	No, line.		
5203	Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe		
5204	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.		
5205	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5206	Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.	dislike anxiety	
5207	How do you know why she waited?	anxiety	
5208	Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.	ecstasy bliss	
5209	What do you want me to do?		
5210	I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	loathing sadness	
5211	But Kate-		
5212	Calm yourself.	calmness	
5213	Calm yourself.	calmness	
5214	Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.	ecstasy calmness	
5215	You above all have got to believe.  You.	bliss	
5216	Why me above all?		
5217	What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.	annoyance	
5218	I can't help it.	disgust	
5219	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?	grief rage	
5220	Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..	ecstasy calmness	
5221	I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.	serenity	
5222	Really?		
5223	I didn't even		
5224	know you applied to U.S.C..		
5225	I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but	serenity	
5226	it's a really good school.  So	pleasantness

5228	That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?	ecstasy delight	
5229	Um, I'm thinking a history and geology minor.	dislike	
5230	Yeah.	serenity	
5231	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
5232	Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school		
5233	and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-		
5234	I know.  It's a great school and you know	delight	
5235	I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program.	calmness acceptance	
5236	It's all about the connections	ecstasy delight	
5237	So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]	ecstasy eagerness	
5238	Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school	pleasantness serenity	
5239	I know.  You're going to be so close.	pleasantness	
5240	And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome	delight ecstasy	
5241	That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here.	bliss	
5242	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're only going to be like twenty minutes apart.	grief	
5243	Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.

5506	Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.	rage loathing	
5507	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5508	Look, I--		
5509	You're not really giving me a lot of options.	enthusiasm	
5510	Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.	serenity	
5511	But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.	grief disgust	
5512	I'm not going to stay here and wait.	anxiety	
5513	I can't do it.	grief rage	
5514	Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?	pleasantness eagerness	
5515	So, um, well, I just -- I kind of wanted to, you know, tell you that I'm actually -- I proposed to Kate and we're going to get married.	ecstasy enthusiasm

5524	She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5525	Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?	ecstasy delight	
5526	I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!	rage dislike

5538	Are you going to have a big wedding or like keep it really small like just, you know, family and really close friends?  Or, I mean--	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5539	It'll be kind of small, but not, you know, not tiny, you know.  I want to have, you know, as many people as we can afford to fly out to Hawaii and put up there for--	serenity acceptance	
5540	It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?	joy	
5541	It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--	joy serenity	
5542	Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5543	Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-	ecstasy eagerness	
5544	Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-	ecstasy serenity	
5545	Yeah, yeah.	serenity	
5546	It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.	ecstasy delight	
5547	Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.	fear	
5548	And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5549	And how did she feel about that?		
5550	Exactly, exactly, exactly.  So--	bliss delight	
5551	She's going to let you have say in the wedding choices?  That's pretty impressive. Very forward-thinking woman. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5552	Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.	pleasantness eagerness	
5553	And brown.		
5554	This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
5555	Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.	pleasantness eagerness	
5556	All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
5557	So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--	eagerness acceptance	
5558	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
5559	You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
5560	I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5561	Only a trivial little broach.	grief loathing	
5562	I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.	pleasantness eagerness	
5563	No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often.	grief	
5564	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	grief terror	
5565	You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	sadness anxiety	
5566	And what of it?		
5567	What of it?		
5568	Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.	ecstasy eagerness	
5569	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious, you never would have heard about it.	pleasantness eagerness	
5570	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	pleasantness eagerness	
5571	I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.	annoyance dislike	
5572	So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?	disgust fear	
5573	I'll have a little I think.		
5574	I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.		
5575	Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5576	You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.	annoyance	
5577	It's becoming a habit with you.	pleasantness	
5578	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	rage loathing	
5579	Don't be so stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
5580	Really, Amanda.		
5581	Just making myself fascinating for you.	delight	
5582	Oh, that reply has broken my heart.	serenity acceptance	
5583	It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5584	No, it's not.		
5585	Oh, Do shut up.	annoyance	
5586	It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	sadness anxiety	
5587	Well, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.	grief anger	
5588	adder don't snap, they sting.	grief fear	
5589	They sting.	fear anger	
5590	They snap.	anger	
5591	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	ecstasy delight	
5592	You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.	ecstasy	
5593	Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.	grief disgust	
5594	I'm not the least bit drunk.	sadness fear	
5595	Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.	fear sadness	
5596	Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.	grief rage	
5597	Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5598	Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.	delight bliss	
5599	Oh, very good idea.  I will.	ecstasy delight	
5600	Ugh.	loathing	
5601	You better turn that off I think.	delight	
5602	Why?	annoyance	
5603	It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.	anger	
5604	There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
5605	Well, there are people downstairs I suppose.	pleasantness eagerness	
5606	They're away in Tunis.		
5607	It is not time of year for Tunis.		
5608	Turn it on again.	ecstasy delight	
5609	I'll do no such thing.		
5610	Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.	disgust anger	
5611	Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.	bliss	
5612	Well, do try to control yourself darling.	bliss joy	
5613	Turn it off.	grief loathing	
5614	You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5615	Turn it off.	grief loathing	
5616	I- I hate you.	sadness	
5617	I hate you.	sadness	
5618	No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.	terror disgust	
5619	Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.	annoyance dislike	
5620	You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.	rage loathing	
5621	Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5622	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?	grief rage	
5623	Fine.	pleasantness	
5624	What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	ecstasy delight	
5625	This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	grief rage	
5626	The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.	grief rage	
5627	You mean our flashlight?		
5628	Well-	pleasantness eagerness	
5629	Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.	ecstasy bliss	
5630	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
5631	I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5632	Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something	grief loathing	
5633	I'm cold.	dislike	
5634	Do you want my jacket?		
5635	It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.	calmness	
5636	Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home?	loathing grief	
5637	Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?	fear melancholy	
5638	Not particularly.		
5639	Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	bliss ecstasy	
5640	Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,	ecstasy pleasantness	
5641	I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	ecstasy delight	
5642	Yeah, they do.	serenity	
5643	All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	grief annoyance	
5644	I'm just not.		
5645	For real?	delight	
5646	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
5647	I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	ecstasy delight	
5648	We weren't in a good spot.	pleasantness	
5649	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.	delight	
5650	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	disgust	
5651	And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	bliss enthusiasm	
5652	Well, so what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
5653	How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
5654	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
5655	When?		
5656	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	grief disgust	
5657	Did you talk to him?		
5658	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
5659	He cried hard.	sadness fear	
5660	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.		
5661	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	ecstasy delight	
5662	I guess, he is.		
5663	What's the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
5664	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	loathing	
5665	What do you mean, dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
5666	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
5667	What are you going to do, argue with him?	anger	
5668	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	loathing	
5669	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	ecstasy delight	
5670	You can't just say that to him.		
5671	How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?	ecstasy pleasantness	
5672	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	loathing anger	
5673	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	ecstasy delight	
5674	The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--	terror loathing	
5675	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	ecstasy calmness	
5676	why?	annoyance	
5677	Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	ecstasy pleasantness	
5678	You know that's not just my business.		
5679	What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?	bliss pleasantness	
5680	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	ecstasy bliss	
5681	She's not Larry's girl!		
5682	As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.	dislike	
5683	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	grief loathing	
5684	To hell with that!	rage	
5685	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	grief loathing	
5686	I want to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
5687	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	sadness	
5688	So what, I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
5689	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	pleasantness eagerness	
5690	Because it is.		
5691	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	joy pleasantness	
5692	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	sadness fear	
5693	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	loathing terror	
5694	All right, then, Mom.	ecstasy calmness	
5695	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	enthusiasm delight	
5696	What the hell is this?	rage	
5697	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	ecstasy delight	
5698	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?	anxiety	
5699	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?	fear	
5700	Must you be inspired?	eagerness	
5701	Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?	grief loathing	
5702	Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!		
5703	I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.	grief terror	
5704	All right, but don't think like that.	grief anger	
5705	I am thinking like that.		
5706	I don't understand you, do I?	grief rage	
5707	No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
5708	Yeah, I can see that.	serenity	
5709	You think it's them?		
5710	Freda is the only one who knows we're up here, and she wouldn't call up.		
5711	It must be them then.		
5712	What will be do?		
5713	Now and always my sweet.	pleasantness	
5714	I don't care then.	disgust	
5715	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
5716	Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	contentment	
5717	Behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5718	Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	ecstasy calmness	
5719	[LAUGHTER] Oh, the things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?	enthusiasm delight	
5720	Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.	sadness	
5721	Darling, don't say that.	bliss joy	
5722	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	bliss ecstasy	
5723	What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	bliss joy	
5724	Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
5725	You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.	dislike	
5726	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.	bliss ecstasy	
5727	Well, if I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.	pleasantness eagerness	
5728	Well, what if-what happens when our love-	joy pleasantness	
5729	Who knows?		
5730	Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
5731	No, that fire will fade along with our passion.	dislike	
5732	Oh, dear, shall we like that?	bliss pleasantness	
5733	It all depends on how well we played.	joy pleasantness	
5734	Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?	ecstasy pleasantness	
5735	My dear, I do believe you're talking nonsense.	bliss joy	
5736	no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --	sadness anger	
5737	enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.	enthusiasm delight	
5738	Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
5739	I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.	ecstasy delight	
5740	Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	fear anger	
5741	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
5742	Which particular one?		
5743	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5744	Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
5745	Horrible thing, I hate it.	terror loathing	
5746	I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	acceptance	
5747	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
5748	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	grief loathing	
5749	Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.	grief loathing	
5750	Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?		
5751	That was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
5752	And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5753	Oh, we were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5754	And very much sillier.	disgust	
5755	Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
5756	You knew there was nothing.	dislike	
5757	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	joy	
5758	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	terror loathing	
5759	No, it's good.	pleasantness	
5760	It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.	joy pleasantness	
5761	So you're not sorry you came?	ecstasy eagerness	
5762	No.  But I'm not going to stay.		
5763	Well your mother has much as told me to leave.	pleasantness eagerness	
5764	Well--	pleasantness eagerness	
5765	What?		
5766	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	pleasantness eagerness	
5767	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	eagerness pleasantness	
5768	I figured they would- your mother at least.		
5769	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	pleasantness eagerness	
5770	Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	pleasantness eagerness	
5771	I guess this is why I came.		
5772	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!	ecstasy delight	
5773	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	dislike annoyance	
5774	Chris, I've been ready for a long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5775	Then, he's gone forever-you're sure?	acceptance serenity	
5776	I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
5777	You started to write me.	serenity acceptance	
5778	You felt something that far back?		
5779	Every day since.		
5780	Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.	anxiety	
5781	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	ecstasy bliss	
5782	Not like that, you're not.	disgust	
5783	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
5784	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?	ecstasy bliss	
5785	Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.	melancholy	
5786	No, what is it, your mother?		
5787	No, nothing like that.		
5788	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	serenity	
5789	I don't know how to start.	terror loathing	
5790	It wouldn't work like this.	grief rage	
5791	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	annoyance	
5792	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5793	yeah sure.	acceptance serenity	
5794	Yeah.  I lost them.	sadness fear	
5795	just about all.		
5796	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	annoyance dislike	
5797	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5798	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	grief loathing	
5799	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	dislike	
5800	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	ecstasy bliss	
5801	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	ecstasy delight	
5802	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	ecstasy delight	
5803	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	bliss enthusiasm	
5804	Do you still feel like that?		
5805	I I want you now, Annie.	grief loathing	
5806	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5807	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!	grief loathing	
5808	Well, so, what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
5809	About what?		
5810	What I was just saying.		
5811	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
5812	I'm not the only one, look at all these people.		
5813	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
5814	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	grief fear	
5815	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	bliss	
5816	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	terror loathing	
5817	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	ecstasy delight	
5818	Why not?		
5819	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?		
5820	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	grief loathing	
5821	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever		
5822	Well, we'll see them this year.	pleasantness eagerness	
5823	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	sadness fear	
5824	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	terror grief	
5825	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	ecstasy delight	
5826	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5827	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	ecstasy delight	
5828	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	ecstasy bliss	
5829	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	grief loathing	
5830	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	grief rage	
5831	No.		
5832	Take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5833	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	rage	
5834	[LAUGHTER] No.	enthusiasm delight	
5835	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	grief	
5836	No.		
5837	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	grief rage	
5838	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	grief disgust	
5839	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	terror loathing	
5840	This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.		
5841	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
5842	Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	anxiety dislike	
5843	Right.		
5844	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.		
5845	Now, I know.  Me either		
5846	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	ecstasy delight	
5847	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	grief loathing	
5848	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	disgust	
5849	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
5850	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	serenity acceptance	
5851	Really?		
5852	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	enthusiasm delight	
5853	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.		
5854	Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
5855	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5856	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	disgust	
5857	Augie, you brought refreshments.	ecstasy delight	
5858	Well, it isn't champagne.	pleasantness eagerness	
5859	Well, then we don't need glasses.	pleasantness eagerness	
5860	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	grief fear	
5861	Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.	serenity	
5862	Or not.		
5863	Or not.		
5864	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?		
5865	Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	pleasantness eagerness	
5866	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	loathing	
5867	What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	grief	
5868	He's not going to marry her.	grief loathing	
5869	Well, so what.	pleasantness eagerness	
5870	What's going on here, Joe?	ecstasy delight	
5871	Now, listen, Kate, just-		
5872	She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.		
5873	You can't read her mind.	grief	
5874	Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	ecstasy bliss	
5875	Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?	grief rage	
5876	Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.	grief annoyance	
5877	I want you to pretend like he's coming back!	sadness disgust	
5878	But, Kate...		
5879	Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.	grief terror	
5880	[LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
5881	Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	terror disgust	
5882	Calm yourself.	calmness	
5883	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.	melancholy	
5884	Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	ecstasy delight	
5885	All right, all right.  Calm yourself.	ecstasy calmness	
5886	Why me, above all?		
5887	You've got to believe. You've got to--	bliss	
5888	What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	annoyance	
5889	I can't help it!	disgust	
5890	Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.	grief loathing	
5891	Oh You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
5892	I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5893	Only a trivial little broach.	grief loathing	
5894	I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.	pleasantness eagerness	
5895	You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?	ecstasy eagerness	
5896	Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.	dislike	
5897	Well, what of it.	pleasantness eagerness	
5898	what of it?		
5899	What about me?		
5900	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.	pleasantness eagerness	
5901	I'm getting very bored with this conversation.	dislike melancholy	
5902	Me, too, bored stiff.	disgust fear	
5903	Do you want some brandy?		
5904	I think I'll have a little.		
5905	No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.	serenity acceptance	
5906	Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5907	You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.	ecstasy delight	
5908	It's becoming a habit with you.	pleasantness	
5909	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.	rage loathing	
5910	Don't be stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
5911	Amanda, really.		
5912	What?		
5913	Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.	eagerness acceptance	
5914	It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?	enthusiasm ecstasy	
5915	Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	calmness pleasantness	
5916	No, it isn't.		
5917	Yes, it is.	ecstasy calmness	
5918	No, it it is not, be quiet.	serenity	
5919	It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	sadness anxiety	
5920	hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	delight ecstasy	
5921	Adders don't snap, they sting.	grief fear	
5922	Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!	terror loathing	
5923	They sting.	fear anger	
5924	They snap.	anger	
5925	Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?	rage disgust	
5926	So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	grief	
5927	You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	ecstasy delight	
5928	[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.	annoyance	
5929	I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.	ecstasy bliss	
5930	I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	sadness fear	
5931	Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.	fear sadness	
5932	Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?		
5933	You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	ecstasy delight	
5934	Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	anger	
5935	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.	grief loathing	
5936	Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	pleasantness eagerness	
5937	They're away in Tunis.		
5938	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	terror loathing	
5939	Turn it on again, please.	ecstasy delight	
5940	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.	acceptance	
5941	Turn it off!	grief loathing	
5942	Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.	grief loathing	
5943	You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.	loathing terror	
5944	Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.	ecstasy	
5945	You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5946	Oh, you're not going like this.		
5947	[GARBAGE] No, you're not.	disgust	
5948	You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!	ecstasy delight	
5949	oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	grief loathing	
5950	You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.	ecstasy delight	
5951	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	grief loathing	
5952	He was out here when it broke.	anger fear	
5953	About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.	grief disgust	
5954	What was he doing out here four in the morning?		
5955	I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	sadness fear	
5956	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
5957	He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
5958	Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.	loathing	
5959	What?		
5960	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
5961	What are you gonna do, argue with him?	anger	
5962	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?	grief anger	
5963	Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	pleasantness eagerness	
5964	You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	ecstasy delight	
5965	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.		
5966	All right.  All right, just listen.	ecstasy calmness	
5967	You know why I invited Annie, right?	contentment acceptance	
5968	You know.		
5969	Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?	grief disgust	
5970	I'm gonna ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
5971	Well, that's your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
5972	You know it's not just my business.		
5973	What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
5974	So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?	ecstasy bliss	
5975	So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime, you know that.	bliss	
5976	Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	enthusiasm delight	
5977	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	acceptance	
5978	She's not Larry's girl.		
5979	Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.	ecstasy delight	
5980	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	grief terror	
5981	what to hell with that!	rage	
5982	Have you asked Annie yet?	grief loathing	
5983	Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.	ecstasy pleasantness	
5984	So what, I'm not fast with women?	loathing	
5985	Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.	rage terror	
5986	she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	joy pleasantness	
5987	Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	terror loathing	
5988	All right then, mom.	ecstasy calmness	
5989	Just give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
5990	But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.	ecstasy delight	
5991	What the hell is this?	rage	
5992	I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
5993	I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
5994	But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?	rage	
5995	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
5996	Must you be inspired?	eagerness	
5997	Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
5998	I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?	grief loathing	
5999	All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.	rage	
6000	I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.	grief terror	
6001	Don't think like that, do you hear me?		
6002	I don't understand you, do I?	grief rage	
6003	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
6004	Okay, so big news.	ecstasy delight	
6005	What?		
6006	Come on, what?	ecstasy bliss	
6007	I'm getting married.	ecstasy delight	
6008	Shut up.	annoyance	
6009	No way.	rage	
6010	Yeah.	serenity	
6011	No way, when? when,when, When did it happen?	rage	
6012	Oh my gosh.	eagerness	
6013	[LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
6014	And you actually said yes.  I can't believe it.  I never thought you would get married.	rage disgust	
6015	I know me neither.		
6016	Oh absolutely.	serenity	
6017	Well, we always said we'd be in our thirtieth when we got married. And we were going to get married to each other if we didn't by then	ecstasy pleasantness	
6018	I know, right. What'd we say, when we were thirty nine?		
6019	Thirty nine, yeah.  I can't believe it.  So you broke our pact. Thanks a lot.	acceptance serenity	
6020	Sorry.	grief fear	
6021	Thanks a lot.  Well, okay, you've got to tell me the details.  What did he say?  Where was it?  What happened?	terror loathing	
6022	Um, Well, uh, I don't-I don't know how much planning he had done.	pleasantness eagerness	
6023	It was really beautiful.		
6024	You've got to love that.	joy	
6025	Nice, you love the jazz.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6026	Oh, okay, yeah.	serenity	
6027	So you know like late dinner and champagne and what not.	annoyance	
6028	Were you in Chicago?		
6029	What a guy.  I can't believe it.  So okay, so do you know any details?  When's it going to be?  Anything?	ecstasy delight	
6030	I don't know.  I guess next summer.		
6031	Yeah.  Yeah, of course.	ecstasy calmness	
6032	So next fall I guess.	sadness	
6033	Next fall.	sadness	
6034	Are you going to do it in town or are you out of town?	ecstasy bliss	
6035	oh, We'll do it in town.	ecstasy bliss	
6036	Oh, okay.	serenity	
6037	Yeah, where's he from again?	serenity	
6038	He's from Chicago as well.	pleasantness eagerness	
6039	Yeah.	serenity	
6040	Exactly, yeah.  I can't believe you met him in Africa.	rage	
6041	And the chances, what are the chances of meeting somebody in Africa and then coming back to Chicago?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6042	Right, being like oh, where are you from?  The U.S.  Where in the U.S.?  Chicago.  Where in Chicago?		
6043	[LAUGHTER] I am sil	enthusiasm delight	
6044	Knowing the neighborhood.  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.	ecstasy delight

6046	Yeah.	serenity	
6047	That is amazing.  You must be so excited.  Did you tell your mom?	delight joy	
6048	Mm-hmm.	grief loathing	
6049	Oh, did she cry?	sadness	
6050	I knew it.  I knew it, of course she does.  How could you not love Mr. Peace Corps worker man?  He's the nicest guy ever.	ecstasy calmness	
6051	Yeah, she-yeah, that's my type.	serenity	
6052	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm

6057	Yeah, we all have to hang out now.	ecstasy delight	
6058	Of course, of course she will ... of course she will.  Yeah, don't go and disappear like everyone else after they get married and I never see them again.  That'll make me mad.  You don't want to make me mad.  You know how I get when I get mad.	grief terror	
6059	Exactly.	bliss delight	
6060	Exactly, "laugh".	ecstasy bliss	
6061	Sorry.	grief fear	
6062	ahh I was always worried you'd be a little bit jealous of me, but I was never quite that lucky.	loathing melancholy

6102	What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--	ecstasy delight	
6103	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	grief loathing	
6104	Fine.	pleasantness	
6105	Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	grief loathing

6117	you want my jacket?		
6118	It's after eleven, let's go home.	calmness acceptance	
6119	Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.	loathing grief	
6120	Right.		
6121	That's my point.		
6122	So let's go.	acceptance	
6123	No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?	fear melancholy	
6124	I just don't.		
6125	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	ecstasy bliss	
6126	Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	grief fear	
6127	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6128	Yeah they do.	serenity	
6129	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	serenity acceptance	
6130	I am just not.		
6131	For real?	delight	
6132	I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.	delight ecstasy	
6133	Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	grief loathing	
6134	We weren't in a good spot.	pleasantness	
6135	We didn't see them the first time either.

6137	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.	delight ecstasy	
6138	Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	disgust melancholy	
6139	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6140	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	grief terror	
6141	That's the wind.		
6142	Well, So what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
6143	baby, I need you to sit down.	ecstasy

6154	What am I going to do?		
6155	I don't know "sigh".	melancholy

6162	It's going to be at least six months, probably a year. I tried.		
6163	I don't understand why they would just do something like this?	grief rage	
6164	I know, I know.  It's really, really messed up.	grief rage	
6165	It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.	grief rage	
6166	Believe me, if I had a choice, I wouldn't have chosen this.	calmness acceptance	
6167	You don't know how to what?  You'll be fine. I mean, you're a great parent. I know.	terror disgust	
6168	They're six months old. Six months old, they're tiny.	disgust

6170	Your Your mom, you want me to move in with your mom?	ecstasy delight	
6171	I don't know, I'm just--I'm trying to think of something.		
6172	She doesn't even like me.  She's never liked me. No.	disgust	
6173	She likes you. Of course, she likes you.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6174	I no I can't- "sigh"	contentment	
6175	You can't what?		
6176	I can't let you go.  I can't let you go.  I'll call them.  I'll say something.  I'll do anything.  I'll tell them something different.	dislike	
6177	Well, we can try it.  Baby, don't beg me.  I mean, if there were anything that I could do, I would do it.  Believe me.  This is not what I want.	ecstasy bliss

6179	What are you going to do that's any different than anybody else?		
6180	I don't know.  Baby, why are you asking me this?  It's just as hard for me.  Please, try to understand that.	ecstasy bliss	
6181	I don't know.  It's not me, so I'm the one who has to stay here.  I'm the one who has to take care of them, and I don't have-I don't have anybody else.  You're all I have.	pleasantness eagerness

6191	I'm going to miss their first words.	grief rage	
6192	I know.		
6193	You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.		
6194	I don't know. I hope so.	ecstasy

6208	Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?	enthusiasm pleasantness	
6209	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	disgust	
6210	Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?	pleasantness eagerness	
6211	Hmm. Mmm.	grief loathing	
6212	Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6213	yeah.	serenity	
6214	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
6215	Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	ecstasy eagerness

6222	Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.	loathing	
6223	It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.	ecstasy acceptance	
6224	I completely understand.	ecstasy bliss	
6225	Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.	serenity

6235	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.		
6236	He saw it.	sadness fear	
6237	When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?		
6238	When?		
6239	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?		
6240	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	ecstasy delight	
6241	He cried hard?	sadness fear	
6242	I could hear him right through the floor in my room.	grief loathing	
6243	What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.	ecstasy delight	
6244	I guess he is.		
6245	What's the meaning of that?	ecstasy delight	
6246	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
6247	What do you mean dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
6248	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
6249	What do you want to do, argue with him?	anger	
6250	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	ecstasy delight	
6251	You can't say that to him.		
6252	We have to say it to him.		
6253	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	pleasantness	
6254	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	loathing anger	
6255	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	ecstasy delight	
6256	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.		
6257	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	ecstasy delight	
6258	Why?	annoyance	
6259	Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6260	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
6261	It's not just my business.		
6262	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	disgust	
6263	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	ecstasy bliss	
6264	I'm just saying.		
6265	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	bliss ecstasy	
6266	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	enthusiasm delight	
6267	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	acceptance	
6268	She is not Larry's girl!		
6269	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	grief loathing	
6270	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	calmness eagerness	
6271	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6272	Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6273	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	joy pleasantness	
6274	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
6275	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	pleasantness eagerness	
6276	Because it is.		
6277	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	eagerness pleasantness	
6278	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	joy calmness	
6279	Just give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
6280	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	ecstasy delight	
6281	What the hell is this?	rage	
6282	Are you crazy?	dislike	
6283	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
6284	What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?		
6285	Yes.  On this, I would.	ecstasy calmness	
6286	You can't think like that.		
6287	Well, you help me stay here.	pleasantness eagerness	
6288	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	rage	
6289	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	grief terror	
6290	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?		
6291	I am thinking that way.		
6292	Yeah, I can see that.	serenity	
6293	I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?	terror loathing	
6294	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6295	So, you're not sorry I came?	ecstasy eagerness	
6296	No.  But I'm not going to stay.		
6297	Well-	pleasantness eagerness	
6298	You saw that.  And well you've been --	pleasantness eagerness	
6299	What?		
6300	You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.	dislike	
6301	Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.	eagerness pleasantness	
6302	Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.	pleasantness eagerness	
6303	Yes, that's why I came.	ecstasy calmness	
6304	Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I	ecstasy delight	
6305	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	loathing terror	
6306	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6307	So he's gone forever then?  You sure?	acceptance serenity	
6308	You started to write me.	serenity acceptance	
6309	You felt something that far back?		
6310	Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?	grief loathing	
6311	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	anxiety	
6312	Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --	ecstasy delight	
6313	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	ecstasy delight	
6314	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.	delight	
6315	Not like that you're not.	disgust	
6316	I kissed you.	ecstasy delight	
6317	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	ecstasy bliss	
6318	Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.	melancholy	
6319	No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?		
6320	No, nothing like that.		
6321	You have to tell me.		
6322	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	fear disgust	
6323	You have to tell me.		
6324	I don't I don't know where to start.		
6325	It wouldn't work like this.	grief rage	
6326	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	annoyance	
6327	You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6328	I lost them.	sadness fear	
6329	Just about all.		
6330	For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.	rage sadness	
6331	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.	fear anger	
6332	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	ecstasy bliss	
6333	Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?	ecstasy calmness	
6334	I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.	sadness fear	
6335	So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.	ecstasy delight	
6336	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	loathing fear	
6337	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	bliss ecstasy	
6338	And I guess that included you.	serenity acceptance	
6339	I want you now, Annie.	grief loathing	
6340	And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6341	Oh, Annie,	grief loathing	
6342	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.	grief loathing	
6343	Oh Good God.	rage terror	
6344	Do you think it's them?		
6345	I wonder.	delight	
6346	What do we do?		
6347	Now and always, my sweet.	pleasantness	
6348	It was bound to happen sooner or later.	ecstasy delight	
6349	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	loathing fear	
6350	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
6351	Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.	contentment	
6352	With the worst- with the most perfect poise?	bliss enthusiasm	
6353	I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	anxiety	
6354	Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--	delight	
6355	things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	grief loathing	
6356	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	terror loathing	
6357	Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	bliss joy	
6358	Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.	bliss delight	
6359	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
6360	You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.	dislike	
6361	uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	enthusiasm delight	
6362	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
6363	Well, will we always bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
6364	Well, it depends on how well we played.	joy pleasantness	
6365	What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	ecstasy	
6366	Yes, yes, with all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
6367	No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	rage grief	
6368	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6369	[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	ecstasy calmness	
6370	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6371	Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.	fear anger	
6372	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
6373	Which particular one?		
6374	The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	bliss ecstasy	
6375	Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
6376	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	terror loathing	
6377	I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	acceptance	
6378	How long did that roue last?	grief loathing	
6379	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
6380	Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?	grief loathing	
6381	[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?	sadness fear	
6382	That was the first time you hit me.	loathing sadness	
6383	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
6384	Very much sillier.	disgust	
6385	You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
6386	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
6387	It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
6388	I am not the only one, look at all these people.		
6389	Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start	ecstasy eagerness	
6390	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
6391	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	grief fear	
6392	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	bliss	
6393	God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	terror loathing	
6394	What's bugging you?	annoyance	
6395	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	ecstasy	
6396	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	ecstasy delight	
6397	Why not?		
6398	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	grief loathing	
6399	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.		
6400	Well We will see them this year.	pleasantness eagerness	
6401	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	ecstasy calmness	
6402	I thought you wanted to see it.	ecstasy delight	
6403	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	ecstasy delight	
6404	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	terror grief	
6405	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	serenity acceptance	
6406	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	grief loathing	
6407	When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.	ecstasy delight	
6408	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	ecstasy delight	
6409	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6410	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6411	Wait a minute, I got it.	anxiety	
6412	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	grief loathing	
6413	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.	ecstasy calmness	
6414	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	terror melancholy	
6415	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	ecstasy delight	
6416	No.		
6417	You want me to go get some champagne?	enthusiasm	
6418	No.		
6419	No.		
6420	What, you want me to whisper in your ear?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6421	No.		
6422	No no.		
6423	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	grief rage	
6424	What.  Welcome to the human race.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6425	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	ecstasy eagerness	
6426	Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	terror loathing	
6427	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.		
6428	Yes it is.	ecstasy calmness	
6429	Right.		
6430	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	pleasantness	
6431	No, I know me either.		
6432	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?		
6433	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	pleasantness serenity	
6434	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	enthusiasm delight	
6435	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.		
6436	Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
6437	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6438	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6439	Augie, you bought refreshments.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6440	Well, it's not champagne.	pleasantness eagerness	
6441	Well than we don't need glasses.	pleasantness eagerness	
6442	Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?	calmness	
6443	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.		
6444	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	annoyance	
6445	Or not.		
6446	Or not.		
6447	Hi, I need an ID.		
6448	Okay, I'm sorry, but I just stood in this line for an hour.  can I Is there any way I can-	rage grief	
6449	I mean, there's really nothing I can do for you in this line.  This is not the line for new I.D.  This is the line for registration.	enthusiasm delight	
6450	No, they told me-I'm sorry, but they told me to be in this line.	ecstasy eagerness	
6451	What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?		
6452	Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6453	Can you just-can I just get the right-		
6454	Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6455	Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?		
6456	There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6457	I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and-	ecstasy bliss	
6458	I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day.	anxiety	
6459	So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-	ecstasy pleasantness	
6460	I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.	grief fear	
6461	And how long is that going to take?	ecstasy delight	
6462	Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.	grief loathing	
6463	I don't-		
6464	I don't have time for this today, and-	grief terror	
6465	But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.	loathing rage	
6466	Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6467	I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.	rage grief	
6468	Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.	acceptance	
6469	Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.	grief terror	
6470	what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.	acceptance	
6471	No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.	joy	
6472	what The lady, what? the janitor?	joy	
6473	No.		
6474	You asked the janitor what line to stand in?  Obviously, that's not going to be the right thing.	loathing rage	
6475	No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
6476	It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.	grief rage	
6477	Why not?		
6478	Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?	joy calmness	
6479	I told you it was line two A.	grief	
6480	Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.	None	
6481	I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.	loathing grief	
6482	Fine.	pleasantness	
6483	Why did you invite her here?	contentment acceptance	
6484	Why does that bother you?	anxiety	
6485	She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?		
6486	Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.	pleasantness eagerness	
6487	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	loathing	
6488	What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.	ecstasy delight	
6489	He's not going to marry her.	grief loathing	
6490	Why do you think he's even thinking that?		
6491	He's got that about it.		
6492	Well, so what?	pleasantness eagerness	
6493	What's going on here, Joe?	ecstasy delight	
6494	Now listen.		
6495	You don't know.  You can't read her mind.	grief	
6496	Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.	dislike anxiety	
6497	How do you know why she's waited?	anxiety	
6498	Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?	grief rage	
6499	Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	grief dislike	
6500	Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?	pleasantness eagerness	
6501	No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!	grief terror	
6502	But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.	delight joy	
6503	Calm yourself.	calmness	
6504	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.	melancholy	
6505	What do you mean, me above all?		
6506	What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.	annoyance	
6507	I can't help it.	disgust	
6508	What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?	grief rage	
6509	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	sadness fear	
6510	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6511	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	sadness fear	
6512	Right.		
6513	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	pleasantness eagerness	
6514	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	ecstasy delight	
6515	That's good.	pleasantness	
6516	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	grief loathing	
6517	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6518	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6519	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6520	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6521	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	serenity	
6522	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6523	And you couldn't find it?		
6524	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	grief loathing	
6525	Are you sure?	acceptance	
6526	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	bliss pleasantness	
6527	Okay.	serenity	
6528	--really important stuff.	ecstasy delight	
6529	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	bliss ecstasy	
6530	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6531	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6532	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	ecstasy eagerness	
6533	I am sorry, ma'am.	grief fear	
6534	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	delight calmness	
6535	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	pleasantness eagerness	
6536	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6537	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	ecstasy responsiveness	
6538	Right. Yes, ma'am.	ecstasy calmness	
6539	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	ecstasy bliss	
6540	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	enthusiasm bliss	
6541	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	ecstasy bliss	
6542	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	ecstasy bliss	
6543	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
6544	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6545	Uh, so it was really heavy.	dislike	
6546	So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.	sadness fear	
6547	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	bliss ecstasy	
6548	There's nothing else you can do?	dislike	
6549	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	pleasantness eagerness	
6550	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	loathing rage	
6551	No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6552	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	ecstasy eagerness	
6553	makes up?	bliss	
6554	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	delight	
6555	You could go into the computer and- you know- print-		
6556	I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.	grief annoyance	
6557	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	grief disgust	
6558	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	ecstasy bliss	
6559	And you have no guarantee.	dislike	
6560	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	sadness fear	
6561	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	sadness fear	
6562	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	calmness eagerness	
6563	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	rage terror	
6564	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	pleasantness eagerness	
6565	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	ecstasy bliss	
6566	Right.		
6567	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	joy	
6568	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	bliss ecstasy	
6569	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6570	Thanks.	acceptance	
6571	You have a wonderful day.	delight	
6572	Brian, I need help.	grief terror	
6573	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
6574	I don't--I'm just--I'm thinking maybe I should move back home or something.  I don't I don't know what to do.  I can't - I cant keep living the way I'm living.	terror loathing	
6575	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	ecstasy calmness	
6576	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	ecstasy pleasantness	
6577	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	grief terror	
6578	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	grief disgust	
6579	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
6580	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	loathing sadness	
6581	Nothing's impossible.	annoyance dislike	
6582	It's not fair.	dislike	
6583	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	sadness disgust	
6584	I		
6585	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.		
6586	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	pleasantness	
6587	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	dislike annoyance	
6588	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	dislike	
6589	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	ecstasy delight	
6590	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6591	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	disgust	
6592	This is humiliating.	disgust	
6593	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	rage disgust	
6594	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	ecstasy pleasantness	
6595	Have you?  There's got to be something else.		
6596	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	enthusiasm bliss	
6597	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	enthusiasm	
6598	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	grief disgust	
6599	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	enthusiasm delight	
6600	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	ecstasy bliss	
6601	But that doesn't help me when I'm hungry now.	anger	
6602	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	ecstasy pleasantness
