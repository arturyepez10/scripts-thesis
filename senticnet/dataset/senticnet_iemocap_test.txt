126	Well.	pleasantness eagerness	
127	What?		
128	Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.	eagerness pleasantness	
129	I knew they would.		
130	You did?		
131	So would you want to?  I mean, I guess you have to know that's kind of why I asked you to come?		
132	I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.	annoyance	
133	Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.	ecstasy delight

139	I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.	delight ecstasy	
140	Not like that you're not.	disgust	
141	Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.	enthusiasm bliss	
142	You've got to tell me.		
143	Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.	serenity	
144	I wonder.	delight	
145	Now and always, sweet.	pleasantness	
146	I don't care then.	disgust	
147	It had to happen sooner or later.	annoyance	
148	[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.	anxiety	
149	We'll behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
150	Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.	grief dislike	
151	Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.	calmness pleasantness	
152	Who's they?		
153	All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them, be flippant.	sadness fear	
154	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
155	Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	disgust	
156	Oh dear, should we like that?	disgust	
157	Yes.  Yes with all of his might.	ecstasy calmness	
158	Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.	disgust	
159	Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.	ecstasy pleasantness	
160	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
161	Which particular one?		
162	I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that.	grief dislike	
163	Oh And it burnt my comb, too, and all of those towels in the bathroom.	grief loathing	
164	Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.	dislike	
165	I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.	ecstasy delight	
166	I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.	ecstasy	
167	Then why is that fair?  Why--	acceptance	
168	There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.		
169	I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix.	sadness annoyance	
170	Just, you know, kicking myself.	rage	
171	I just don't see why it has to be you.		
172	Don't you guys have access to computers over there.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
173	I know.		
174	I'll send you lots of letters.		
175	They're out there swimming right now...		
176	...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...	enthusiasm delight	
177	Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.	grief disgust	
178	That's the wind.		
179	Well, so?  What do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
180	About what?		
181	I think it's ridiculous.	dislike	
182	It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.	serenity	
183	They're all told the same thing.		
184	Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.	ecstasy bliss	
185	Their life will start then.	ecstasy delight	
186	Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	terror loathing	
187	I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	ecstasy	
188	Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.	ecstasy delight	
189	Why not?		
190	Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.		
191	Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.	delight serenity	
192	No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.	loathing anxiety	
193	I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.	ecstasy delight	
194	Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.	ecstasy delight	
195	you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.	pleasantness serenity	
196	Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go."	pleasantness joy	
197	So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--		
198	And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
199	Oh right sure, of course.	ecstasy calmness	
200	You want me to go get some champagne?	enthusiasm	
201	Do you want to take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
202	No.		
203	I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.	grief disgust	
204	Well, welcome to the human race.	ecstasy eagerness	
205	You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.	ecstasy calmness	
206	Yeah, it is.	serenity	
207	Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.	ecstasy serenity	
208	I know me neither.		
209	You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.	annoyance	
210	Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.		
211	We do have really good view of the moon from here though.	enthusiasm delight	
212	Augie, you brought refreshments.	ecstasy delight	
213	I guess we don't need glasses.		
214	Or not.		
215	Yeah.  I heard.	serenity	
216	And, um, I got married.	ecstasy delight	
217	Who did you marry?	ecstasy delight	
218	Did you propose to you?	enthusiasm delight	
219	Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.	ecstasy calmness	
220	It was at the slot machines.		
221	[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.	enthusiasm delight	
222	Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?	grief loathing	
223	Yeah.	serenity	
224	like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.	anxiety

227	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	loathing	
228	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	ecstasy bliss	
229	Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.	loathing fear	
230	Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	anger melancholy	
231	I won't stand for any nonsense.	loathing	
232	Kate.		
233	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
234	Okay. Calm yourself.	calmness	
235	Look at you, you're shaking.	annoyance	
236	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	grief rage	
237	I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	sadness anxiety	
238	Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.	ecstasy pleasantness	
239	Well, what of it?	pleasantness eagerness	
240	It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
241	I'll have a little, I think.		
242	I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.	dislike	
243	Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.	rage loathing	
244	Don't be stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
245	Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.	ecstasy calmness	
246	Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.	sadness anxiety	
247	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	grief	
248	And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.	ecstasy bliss	
249	Mind your own business.	annoyance	
250	I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.	sadness fear	
251	Shut up.	annoyance	
252	Why?	annoyance	
253	They are away in Tunis.		
254	This is no time of year for Tunis.	terror loathing	
255	Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	terror disgust	
256	Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.	grief loathing	
257	I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.	loathing terror	
258	Amanda, listen, listen.		
259	Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.	ecstasy	
260	This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
261	You're not going like this.		
262	Oh.  Yes I am.	ecstasy calmness	
263	Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	grief anger	
264	Do you have your forms?	ecstasy delight	
265	Let me see them.		
266	Is there a problem?	anger fear	
267	You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.	ecstasy pleasantness	
268	Who the hell has a birth certificate?	rage	
269	That's out of control.	dislike	
270	I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.	ecstasy delight	
271	Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--		
272	What flashlight?		
273	Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?	contentment acceptance	
274	That's not your flashlight.		
275	Whose is it?	anger	
276	It's ours; it's my flashlight, too.		
277	Oh, well, yeah of course.	ecstasy pleasantness	
278	Are you all right?  Are you okay?  You cold?  Do you want to my jacket? My jacket? No?	dislike	
279	I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.	terror dislike	
280	I wonder if they can hear me talking, you know.	delight	
281	It's after eleven, let's go home.	calmness acceptance	
282	What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?	loathing sadness	
283	Right.		
284	That's my point too.		
285	Don't you want to see it?	grief loathing	
286	People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.	ecstasy bliss	
287	Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.	grief fear	
288	Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
289	I'm not.		
290	For real?	delight	
291	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
292	Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
293	They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...	joy acceptance	
294	What's he going to say?		
295	What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning?		
296	I don't know.		
297	He's dreaming of him again, walking around.	ecstasy delight	
298	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.	loathing	
299	You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
300	I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.	loathing	
301	You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?	grief	
302	We've got to say it to him.		
303	Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.		
304	You know it's not just my business.		
305	So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?	ecstasy bliss	
306	Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.	acceptance	
307	I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.	grief loathing	
308	I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?	grief loathing	
309	I wanted to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
310	Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	ecstasy pleasantness	
311	So what.  I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
312	Because it is.		
313	You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	rage grief	
314	Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?	contentment acceptance	
315	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
316	Oh.  Must you be inspired?	eagerness	
317	I know that.  Then just help me stay here.	grief terror	
318	I don't understand you, do I?	grief rage	
319	No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	grief loathing	
320	I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.	disgust	
321	What kind of a job?	ecstasy bliss	
322	He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.	ecstasy delight	
323	He just...		
324	Yeah.	serenity	
325	Hmm.	grief loathing	
326	What did he do?  What was so great?  I don't understand why they would pick him over me.	grief dislike	
327	I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--	pleasantness	
328	A resume?		
329	Yeah.  Do you have a resume?	serenity	
330	No.		
331	No.  But it has an outline, you know.	grief loathing	
332	I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.	disgust	
333	Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.	serenity	
334	..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.	grief loathing	
335	That's baloney, that's baloney.	disgust	
336	I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.	annoyance	
337	Why?  What choice?	annoyance	
338	To save the environment, carpool.	delight joy	
339	Interesting.  That's fantastic.	ecstasy bliss	
340	You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...	fear anger	
341	Who do you think you are?		
342	The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.	ecstasy delight	
343	you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.	grief anger	
344	Hi.		
345	Hi.  Thanks for waiting.	acceptance	
346	Okay.	serenity	
347	I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.	anxiety	
348	Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.	grief fear	
349	No G.		
350	all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?	sadness fear	
351	Flight seven fourteen.		
352	Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
353	No, no.		
354	So you'll give me money and then I'll get my bag?	serenity acceptance	
355	You're kidding me, this is a joke.	grief loathing	
356	Once again, I'm really- I'm really sorry.	grief fear	
357	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
358	I'm very sorry.  But if you see the sign that's right behind me here, it spells it out really clearly that we are not held liable--	ecstasy bliss	
359	Okay. Calm-	calmness	
360	Do you understand who my husband is?	ecstasy bliss	
361	You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	responsiveness	
362	Because I probably know him.		
363	Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--	ecstasy eagerness	
364	Sean.  Great. Do you have a badge number or something?	loathing fear	
365	Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.	enthusiasm delight	
366	Okay.  I'll do that.	serenity	
367	Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...	pleasantness	
368	Yeah. That is so awesome.	pleasantness serenity	
369	Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]	rage terror	
370	This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.	sadness disgust	
371	I know. We should throw a party.	sadness disgust	
372	Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice	ecstasy delight	
373	Um, yeah, yeah.  I'm a TA for two sessions. Mmhmm.	acceptance serenity	
374	You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.	rage	
375	No, no, no.		
376	Hmm.	grief loathing	
377	So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.	loathing fear	
378	Mmhmm.		
379	I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.	grief loathing	
380	Yeah.	serenity	
381	How long were you there for?	ecstasy delight	
382	I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.	enthusiasm delight	
383	You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?	enthusiasm delight	
384	Is it a big cemetery?	grief loathing	
385	Yeah.	serenity	
386	Mmhmm.		
387	Good God.	rage terror	
388	Do you think it's them?		
389	Oh...		
390	Oh. Behave exquisitely...	ecstasy enthusiasm	
391	[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.	anxiety	
392	Ah...		
393	Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?	joy	
394	Darling, don't say that.	bliss joy	
395	Oh whose they?	anger	
396	Oh you know all those superficial philosophers. We must laugh at them, be flippant.	disgust anger	
397	How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	anger dislike	
398	Ahh...who knows.	joy calmness	
399	If one of us dies...	grief terror	
400	Well, that's serious enough isn't it?	eagerness pleasantness	
401	No, no, no, no death is very laughable it's a cunning little mystery, you know.  It's all done with mirrors.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
402	I think you're talking nonsense.	grief loathing	
403	Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]	sadness anger	
404	Oh, Elliot.  Worms don't pop.	disgust	
405	Oh, thank you darling.	bliss joy	
406	Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
407	It was a horrible thing I hated it.	terror loathing	
408	It went on intermittently for days.	ecstasy delight	
409	Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.	pleasantness	
410	You're not sorry you came?	ecstasy eagerness	
411	Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.	ecstasy eagerness	
412	Well.	pleasantness eagerness	
413	You did?		
414	From her point of view why else would I come?		
415	So then would you want to?  I mean I guess, you kind of have to know, maybe that's why I asked you to come.		
416	Ann, I love you.  I love you.	joy	
417	I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.	grief fear	
418	Chris,		
419	So then he's gone.  You sure?	acceptance	
420	You started to write me.	serenity acceptance	
421	Oh Annie, why don't you go ahead and give me a kiss, come on just a...	rage grief	
422	Like Larry's brother.  Do what like you, Chris.	ecstasy delight	
423	Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.	acceptance	
424	No, what is it?  Is your mother?		
425	No, no, it's nothing like that.		
426	Well, then what?  You know, even in your letter you seem kind of ashamed.	fear disgust	
427	I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.	grief loathing	
428	You got to tell me.		
429	It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.	annoyance	
430	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
431	Well I lost them.	pleasantness eagerness	
432	How many?		
433	You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.	grief	
434	You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...	ecstasy bliss	
435	I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.	serenity acceptance	
436	'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you have a right to...		
437	Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...	ecstasy bliss	
438	Well, so, what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
439	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
440	Not just me, look at all of these people.		
441	Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action.	ecstasy eagerness	
442	Well then, what's bugging you?	pleasantness eagerness	
443	There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.	ecstasy delight	
444	I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.	ecstasy calmness	
445	You don't understand anything I am saying.	grief rage	
446	Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.	joy pleasantness	
447	That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?	pleasantness	
448	Sure.  All right.  Okay.	ecstasy calmness	
449	Do you want me to go get some champagne?	enthusiasm	
450	Do you want to take off your shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
451	Do you want to get married again?	ecstasy delight	
452	Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?	grief rage	
453	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
454	Do you know what you get?  You get this.	ecstasy bliss	
455	Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting.	anxiety dislike	
456	Do you understand what I am saying?	ecstasy bliss	
457	I'm doing the best I can.	ecstasy delight	
458	Maybe if you were with someone else, too.		
459	Yeah.  Don't you know that?	serenity	
460	For Heaven's sake Augie.	serenity acceptance	
461	You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.	annoyance	
462	It's not champagne.		
463	Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?	dislike	
464	I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.		
465	Augie, I'm sorry.	grief fear	
466	Or not.		
467	He's not going to marry her.	grief loathing	
468	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.	dislike anxiety	
469	And how do you know why she's waited.	anxiety	
470	Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.	anger melancholy	
471	What do you want me to do?  What do you want?		
472	Kate...		
473	Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.	joy eagerness	
474	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
475	I can't help it.	disgust	
476	[LAUGHTER] Utterly, utterly ridiculous.	dislike	
477	We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
478	Very much sillier.	disgust	
479	Mmhmm.		
480	However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	bliss delight	
481	Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.	grief	
482	And what about me?		
483	That's a nice point of view I must say.	pleasantness	
484	I'll have a little, I think.		
485	Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.	serenity acceptance	
486	I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.	pleasantness	
487	Really, Amanda.		
488	That reply has broken my heart.	grief	
489	Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?	enthusiasm pleasantness	
490	Oh no, it isn't.	disgust	
491	Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	delight bliss	
492	They sting.	fear anger	
493	Yes, I did quite a lot.	ecstasy calmness	
494	You always had a weak head.	anxiety	
495	Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
496	That's a very good idea I think I will.	ecstasy delight	
497	Why?	annoyance	
498	There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
499	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	bliss	
500	I won't.		
501	Turn it off.	grief loathing	
502	Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.	grief disgust	
503	You're not going like this.		
504	Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?	joy calmness	
505	Okay.  Is that, is that--	serenity	
506	No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.	ecstasy delight	
507	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
508	What?		
509	The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?	contentment acceptance	
510	Whose is it?	anger	
511	It's ours; it's my flashlight too.		
512	Oh...well. Yeah, of course.	ecstasy pleasantness	
513	No.		
514	Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.	ecstasy calmness	
515	Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.	enthusiasm bliss	
516	Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?	enthusiasm delight	
517	Do you want my jacket?		
518	It's after eleven, let's go.	acceptance	
519	There is no point.	loathing	
520	Well, then let's go.	eagerness pleasantness	
521	No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?	fear melancholy	
522	Not particularly.		
523	Why not?		
524	I just don't.  It's stupid.	grief rage	
525	This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.	ecstasy delight	
526	Oh Augie		
527	There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.	dislike annoyance	
528	For real?	delight	
529	Yeah.	serenity	
530	And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.	delight ecstasy	
531	We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.	enthusiasm delight	
532	Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.	dislike	
533	Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm.	grief disgust	
534	About what?		
535	What he's going to say?		
536	When?		
537	He was out here at four this morning.		
538	How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed.	ecstasy delight	
539	I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.	ecstasy delight	
540	Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.	grief loathing	
541	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
542	I don't know.		
543	I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.	sadness fear	
544	What do you mean a mistake?	loathing	
545	You can't say that to him.		
546	I got to.		
547	What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?	pleasantness serenity	
548	You know.		
549	Well, that's only your business, Chris.	pleasantness eagerness	
550	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.	disgust	
551	You want to make sure that your father's not going to...	serenity acceptance	
552	I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.	grief fear	
553	To hell with that.	rage	
554	Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.	grief disgust	
555	I don't see why it has to be Annie.	grief loathing	
556	That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	grief loathing	
557	All right then.	ecstasy calmness	
558	I know, I know.		
559	Well, you don't think like that.	pleasantness eagerness	
560	I don't understand you, do I?	grief rage	
561	Why does that bother you?	anxiety	
562	What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?	ecstasy delight	
563	-he's not gonna marry her.	ecstasy delight	
564	What's going on here, Joe?	ecstasy delight	
565	Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?	grief rage	
566	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	grief dislike	
567	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...	ecstasy eagerness	
568	All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.	ecstasy calmness	
569	What?- Why- Why me above all?		
570	What does that mean?  Me above all?		
571	Look at you.  Look at you shaking.	annoyance	
572	I can't help it.	disgust	
573	Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
574	It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
575	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
576	I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.	ecstasy eagerness	
577	Well, what's bugging you?	pleasantness eagerness	
578	For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.	serenity acceptance	
579	Why not?		
580	We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?		
581	We've missed them twice; that's not ever.	grief loathing	
582	I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.		
583	"the Grunion are running tonight," I said "great, let's go, I feel lucky,"	ecstasy delight	
584	We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
585	No.		
586	No.		
587	What? What? You want a divorce?	grief	
588	No.		
589	No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us	ecstasy eagerness	
590	This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.		
591	I know that Augie. Really I do.		
592	For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.	serenity acceptance	
593	Yeah?	serenity	
594	Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?	acceptance	
595	You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?	calmness	
596	No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.	ecstasy	
597	Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.	annoyance	
598	Or not.		
599	Hmm.	grief loathing	
600	I know, it went out of style, didn't it?	terror loathing	
601	It's all right.  It's a good thing.	ecstasy pleasantness	
602	You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.	joy pleasantness	
603	You're not sorry you came?	ecstasy eagerness	
604	Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.	pleasantness eagerness	
605	I knew they would, your mother anyway.		
606	from her point of view, why else would I come?		
607	Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.		
608	I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.	ecstasy	
609	You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
610	You started to write me and--	serenity acceptance	
611	You felt something that far back?		
612	Anne, why didn't you let me know?		
613	Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-	ecstasy delight	
614	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.	joy	
615	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?	ecstasy bliss	
616	I don't know how to start.	terror loathing	
617	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
618	How many?		
619	Oh, gee.	enthusiasm delight	
620	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	fear anger	
621	I don't care then.	disgust	
622	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	terror loathing	
623	Oh, darling, don't say that.	bliss joy	
624	Yes, meaning just that.	ecstasy delight	
625	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
626	Who's they?		
627	All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.	bliss ecstasy	
628	Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	anger dislike	
629	Depends on how well we've played.	joy pleasantness	
630	That's serious enough, isn't it?	acceptance	
631	Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.	enthusiasm delight	
632	You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
633	The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.	ecstasy pleasantness	
634	Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	ecstasy bliss	
635	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	grief loathing	
636	That was the first time you ever hit me.	loathing sadness	
637	When?		
638	I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.	ecstasy	
639	He cried hard?	sadness fear	
640	I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.	loathing	
641	Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	disgust annoyance	
642	What you mean dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
643	What do you want to do argue with him?	anger	
644	No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?	loathing annoyance	
645	Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?	grief anger	
646	All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?	grief loathing	
647	From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.	joy eagerness	
648	And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?	ecstasy delight	
649	I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.	grief loathing	
650	I wanted to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
651	Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	ecstasy pleasantness	
652	Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	ecstasy pleasantness	
653	Trouble is, you don't see enough women.	sadness	
654	So what, I'm not fast with women.	loathing	
655	I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	grief loathing	
656	Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.	terror anger	
657	These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	contentment acceptance	
658	I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
659	I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
660	But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.	ecstasy delight	
661	I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.	ecstasy delight	
662	Yes, on this I would.	ecstasy calmness	
663	Then help me stay here.	grief terror	
664	How you doing?		
665	Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.	ecstasy delight	
666	Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	ecstasy	
667	How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?	grief rage	
668	What flashlight?		
669	It's ours; it's mine too.		
670	No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally.	ecstasy bliss	
671	Yea.	enthusiasm	
672	oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.	delight enthusiasm	
673	There is no point in coming down here.	loathing sadness	
674	Right.		
675	No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?	fear melancholy	
676	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.	bliss ecstasy	
677	Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.	grief fear	
678	This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.	ecstasy delight	
679	Augie		
680	Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs	grief loathing	
681	And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.	disgust melancholy	
682	We weren't in a good spot.	pleasantness	
683	Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.	ecstasy pleasantness	
684	It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,	bliss delight	
685	they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
686	Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.	dislike	
687	What of it?		
688	Well, what about me?	pleasantness eagerness	
689	Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	pleasantness eagerness	
690	No, thanks.	acceptance	
691	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	annoyance	
692	You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	rage loathing	
693	Don't be so stupid.	ecstasy bliss	
694	Nothing.	dislike	
695	Going out somewhere dear?	enthusiasm bliss	
696	No, just making myself fascinating for you.	delight	
697	No, it isn't.		
698	Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	grief anger	
699	They sting.	fear anger	
700	They snap.	anger	
701	Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.	ecstasy calmness	
702	Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	ecstasy delight	
703	I'm not in the least drunk.	joy eagerness	
704	On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	fear sadness	
705	Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?	delight	
706	Shut up.	annoyance	
707	There are people downstairs I suppose?		
708	They're away in Tunis.		
709	Turn it off.	grief loathing	
710	Amanda, listen. listen		
711	You're not going like this.		
712	Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.	grief rage

And I was like okay, like that's a little weird.	enthusiasm serenity	
717	So, he--so we walked down to the pier and there's like these lights--like these little, like lights-- and we're like what's that? And he's like I don't know let's go find out.	ecstasy calmness	
718	That--that is the most romantic thing I have ever heard.		
719	Yeah.  I mean candles wouldn't stay--No, I didn't--I didn't know anything about it.	serenity

728	Oh, thank you. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm pleasantness	
729	What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I--	grief rage	
730	You could send me pictures.		
731	It's not going to be the same.

735	Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.	ecstasy bliss	
736	All right. Customer service this is Steve.	ecstasy calmness	
737	Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-	serenity responsiveness	
738	Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.	annoyance	
739	So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles	ecstasy delight	
740	Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice.	ecstasy delight	
741	I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.		
742	Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes	ecstasy calmness	
743	it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge.	loathing annoyance

749	Yeah. yeah.	serenity	
750	Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?	delight ecstasy	
751	Yeah.	serenity	
752	if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and	acceptance serenity	
753	Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.	ecstasy pleasantness	
754	Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.	ecstasy delight	
755	Right.  Well.  We still need it.	pleasantness eagerness	
756	Well, I have my driver's license, does that work?	ecstasy bliss

758	Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh...	ecstasy delight	
759	Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is.	ecstasy delight	
760	Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.	terror annoyance	
761	But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me.	disgust melancholy	
762	I can't.		
763	Well, I can give you my Social Security Number.	eagerness pleasantness	
764	No, it's--		
765	The line--		
766	But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?	disgust annoyance	
767	All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.	grief anger	
768	So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
769	Do you have a supervisor?	ecstasy delight	
770	Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.	pleasantness eagerness	
771	What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?	ecstasy delight	
772	Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.	dislike anxiety	
773	But Kate		
774	Wait, why my above all?	anxiety	
775	Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--	grief loathing	
776	Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean?	grief anger	
777	Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-	pleasantness eagerness	
778	How much?		
779	Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean, the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase, but all the things inside, all my clothes, all my personal belongings, the sentimental value, not to mention, which is more-more than all of that together.	ecstasy calmness	
780	That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?	bliss pleasantness	
781	I didn't sign anything.		
782	Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--	pleasantness eagerness	
783	Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--	pleasantness eagerness	
784	Isn't there anything else you can do?	ecstasy calmness	
785	probably even talk to--		
786	but Unfortunately sometimes is--	annoyance	
787	Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.	ecstasy pleasantness	
788	Thank you.	acceptance	
789	Well, so what do you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
790	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	ecstasy delight	
791	It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
792	Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.	pleasantness eagerness	
793	Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.	ecstasy pleasantness	
794	Are we talking about the same thing?	grief loathing	
795	Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?	delight	
796	Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.		
797	No, of course not.	ecstasy calmness	
798	It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.	terror grief	
799	For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.	serenity acceptance	
800	I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.	joy pleasantness	
801	Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--	ecstasy serenity	
802	Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.	ecstasy delight	
803	I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
804	And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	grief disgust	
805	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	ecstasy bliss	
806	It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right?	grief fear	
807	Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?	ecstasy delight	
808	Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?	ecstasy pleasantness	
809	No. No.		
810	What?  What?  You want a divorce?	grief	
811	No.		
812	Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	anxiety dislike	
813	Right.		
814	I know, me neither.		
815	I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?	ecstasy serenity	
816	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.		
817	Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?	acceptance	
818	Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	pleasantness eagerness	
819	Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
820	I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
821	Well, look what we have here.	pleasantness eagerness	
822	Well, then we don't need glasses.	pleasantness eagerness	
823	Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.	calmness	
824	Or not.		
825	So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?	annoyance	
826	Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
827	I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you--	grief rage	
828	No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.	ecstasy	
829	I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand.	enthusiasm delight	
830	I feel so worthless.	grief	
831	It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...	enthusiasm ecstasy	
832	Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-	enthusiasm bliss	
833	Well, you've gotta live.	pleasantness eagerness	
834	I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.	grief	
835	I don't know how to get out of it.  I don't know how to dig myself out of it.  It's the same hole that I've been digging and digging and digging.  I can't--	grief terror	
836	Good God.	rage terror	
837	We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?	ecstasy calmness	
838	Now and always sweet.	pleasantness	
839	It's bound to come sooner or later.	ecstasy delight	
840	Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.	loathing fear	
841	Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.	anxiety	
842	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?	grief loathing	
843	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?	bliss ecstasy	
844	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	calmness pleasantness	
845	You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.	dislike	
846	All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths	sadness fear	
847	flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.	ecstasy delight	
848	Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.	ecstasy delight	
849	I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best.	ecstasy delight	
850	You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	ecstasy	
851	The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.	ecstasy pleasantness	
852	Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
853	Horrible thing, I hated it.	terror loathing	
854	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	grief loathing	
855	That was a rouser, wasn't it?		
856	And very much sillier.	disgust	
857	It's all right.  It's a good thing.	ecstasy pleasantness	
858	What?		
859	How'd you know?		
860	Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?	pleasantness eagerness	
861	Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.		
862	I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.	annoyance	
863	I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.	ecstasy	
864	I almost got married two years ago.	ecstasy delight	
865	Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-	ecstasy delight	
866	No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?		
867	You've gotta tell me.		
868	It wouldn't work this way.	grief rage	
869	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?	ecstasy bliss	
870	How many?		
871	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	bliss delight	
872	I could hear him right through the floor in my room.	grief loathing	
873	I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.	loathing	
874	What do you mean dishonest?	disgust annoyance	
875	What do you want to do, argue with him?	anger	
876	Can you prove it, how can you prove it?	pleasantness	
877	To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?	ecstasy delight	
878	All right. All right. Listen to me.	ecstasy calmness	
879	You know.		
880	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	ecstasy delight	
881	I'm just saying		
882	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	acceptance	
883	She's not Larry's girl.		
884	I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	grief loathing	
885	All right. All right. Mom.	ecstasy calmness	
886	I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
887	I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.	ecstasy delight	
888	What about the business? What is this?		
889	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	fear	
890	Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	ecstasy calmness	
891	Tell me, you'd leave the business?		
892	Just don't go thinking that way.		
893	Well, I am thinking that way.	pleasantness eagerness	
894	I don't understand you, do I?	grief rage	
895	It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that.	grief fear	
896	It's okay.	serenity	
897	I mean--I don't know.		
898	And his whole family was there.	enthusiasm delight	
899	I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know	ecstasy pleasantness	
900	But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--	ecstasy delight	
901	I'm gonna forget him.	sadness	
902	Thanks.	acceptance	
903	This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.	delight	
904	Fine.	pleasantness	
905	Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	ecstasy pleasantness	
906	That's not your flashlight.		
907	It's ours.  It's mine too.		
908	Oh, well sure.	eagerness pleasantness	
909	How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
910	I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
911	You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	contentment acceptance	
912	Right.		
913	So, let's go.	acceptance	
914	I just don't.  It's stupid.	grief rage	
915	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.	bliss ecstasy	
916	Yeah they do.	serenity	
917	Ah, Augie.

1079	The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-	annoyance dislike	
1080	Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	ecstasy pleasantness	
1081	we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-	bliss ecstasy	
1082	because this is ridiculous?	dislike	
1083	I'm sorry. I don't- I-	grief fear

1238	Yeah, that's my point too.	serenity	
1239	Well, so let's go.	eagerness pleasantness	
1240	No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.	loathing sadness	
1241	I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.	ecstasy delight

1270	Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job.	annoyance	
1271	Time is passing by. Every year it's		
1272	a part left than I can do.	ecstasy calmness

1274	That's the thing. I don't know. I don't know anything.		
1275	Law school? Maybe.		
1276	I don't know. I don't know anything other than this, though, is the problem. This is my life. This is what I built everything about, you know.	ecstasy delight	
1277	See? So you can't just quit now.	joy eagerness	
1278	Have you been going to auditions and stuff?	serenity acceptance

1287	You can't read her mind.	grief	
1288	She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-	grief loathing	
1289	Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.	dislike	
1290	Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.	grief terror	
1291	Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.	grief terror

1314	You should tell me.		
1315	You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.	enthusiasm delight	
1316	How many?		
1317	And I, and I thought something watching them go down.	pleasantness	
1318	And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	ecstasy delight	
1319	And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.	loathing grief	
1320	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.	disgust fear	
1321	And you still feel that way?		
1322	Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.	serenity acceptance	
1323	What am I going to do with a fortune?	serenity	
1324	Good God.	rage terror	
1325	Yes, meaning just that.	ecstasy delight	
1326	What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?	bliss pleasantness	
1327	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	ecstasy	
1328	No. The fire will fade along with our passion.	dislike	
1329	Oh dear, well, shall we want that?	disgust	
1330	So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.	sadness fear	
1331	Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1332	Horrible little thing. I hated it.	terror loathing	
1333	The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.	grief loathing	
1334	I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
1335	Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].	enthusiasm delight	
1336	Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?	sadness fear	
1337	I had my luggage transferred here from Paris to L.A. and now I'm here and I need to be working and I have all my stuff in there.	ecstasy bliss	
1338	Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.	loathing grief	
1339	No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there.	grief loathing	
1340	Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay	ecstasy delight	
1341	You know, we'll file a complaint and we could possibly, you know, replace some of the things. I think-	grief rage	
1342	and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.	grief rage	
1343	Sir, why are you laughing at me? This isn't funny.	sadness anger	
1344	I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.	grief rage	
1345	About what?		
1346	It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
1347	It's just...		
1348	Why not?		
1349	We never do, do we?  Have we ever?		
1350	Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.	grief loathing	
1351	Carla, can I ask you something?		
1352	What's bugging you then?	annoyance	
1353	Well, we're going to see it.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1354	And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.		
1355	Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1356	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	ecstasy bliss	
1357	Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?	ecstasy pleasantness	
1358	No.		
1359	Do you want me to get some champagne?		
1360	Take off our shoes?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1361	No.		
1362	Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?	grief rage	
1363	I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.	grief disgust	
1364	This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.	ecstasy calmness	
1365	Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.	pleasantness	
1366	This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?		
1367	I didn't say that.		
1368	I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	joy	
1369	Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.	grief loathing	
1370	Yeah.  Don't you know that?	serenity	
1371	Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.		
1372	It seemed like a good spot to me.	pleasantness	
1373	Big old white moon.	disgust	
1374	It's not champagne.		
1375	Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.	calmness

1381	How many pieces of luggage do you have checked in?	annoyance	
1382	And what are you going to do about it?  You going to call someone?  You going to send me somewhere else?

1411	Well, what do you mean? What?	pleasantness eagerness	
1412	You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	bliss ecstasy	
1413	No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.	sadness fear

1443	You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.	ecstasy	
1444	You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.	grief fear	
1445	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	fear sadness	
1446	Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.	ecstasy enthusiasm

1475	There is no point in coming down here.	loathing sadness	
1476	Why not?		
1477	I don't know.  I just don't.		
1478	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.	disgust	
1479	I'm just not.		
1480	You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.	fear anger	
1481	You didn't see them the first time either.		
1482	We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.	enthusiasm delight	
1483	It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.	grief disgust	
1484	Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.	grief disgust

1797	Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1798	I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.	anxiety	
1799	Not like that you're not.	disgust	
1800	Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.	terror disgust	
1801	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1802	Yeah, sure.	acceptance serenity	
1803	For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	enthusiasm delight	
1804	a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.	ecstasy delight	
1805	There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	grief disgust	
1806	And do you still feel that way?		
1807	Good God.	rage terror	
1808	Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	loathing	
1809	Behave exquisitely.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1810	Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.	anxiety	
1811	It all depends on how well we've played.	joy pleasantness	
1812	Yes.  Yes, with all his might.	ecstasy calmness	
1813	Elliot, worms don't pop.	disgust	
1814	The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed?	ecstasy pleasantness	
1815	I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	bliss pleasantness	
1816	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
1817	It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.	grief loathing	
1818	I didn't hit you very hard.	delight joy	
1819	The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.	enthusiasm delight	
1820	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
1821	Why does that bother you?	anxiety	
1822	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--		
1823	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	loathing	
1824	Line.		
1825	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.		
1826	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	dislike anxiety	
1827	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	grief dislike	
1828	But, Kate--		
1829	Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?	anger disgust	
1830	She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--	joy serenity	
1831	Calm yourself.	calmness	
1832	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone	melancholy	
1833	Calm yourself.	calmness	
1834	Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.	ecstasy calmness	
1835	You, above all, have got to believe.  You.	bliss	
1836	What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.	annoyance	
1837	I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.	ecstasy delight	
1838	and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.	eagerness joy	
1839	I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-	enthusiasm	
1840	Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1841	Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.		
1842	You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-	ecstasy bliss	
1843	Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-	ecstasy bliss	
1844	Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.	ecstasy bliss	
1845	I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-	pleasantness eagerness	
1846	Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.	ecstasy bliss	
1847	Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?	bliss ecstasy	
1848	Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.	joy pleasantness	
1849	And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?	ecstasy delight	
1850	[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.	enthusiasm delight	
1851	you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1852	or some- some large percent of- of success.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1853	Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could.	ecstasy bliss	
1854	What do you want me to? Look, Hey look if I could- Don't get all sassy.	annoyance	
1855	Well you- just you're doing something wrong.	pleasantness eagerness	
1856	So, go to McDonalds.		
1857	I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.	ecstasy bliss	
1858	I'm trying to watch TV. TV.	ecstasy	
1859	That's important.  That's really important.	ecstasy delight	
1860	You guys lost my bag.	sadness fear	
1861	Did you file a complaint already?	grief loathing	
1862	Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-	calmness	
1863	Lost it just, like, I mean,	sadness fear	
1864	Ma'am, I understand that.	ecstasy bliss	
1865	because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.	sadness disgust	
1866	Wait.  What?	anxiety	
1867	You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.	ecstasy calmness	
1868	We're just talking over each other.	grief loathing	
1869	We're not going to communicate anything this way.	grief loathing	
1870	sign away your luggage to the	annoyance	
1871	terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over	ecstasy responsiveness	
1872	The best that we can do for you is give you-	ecstasy delight	
1873	I am the supervisor, ma'am.	ecstasy delight	
1874	I am the current manager on duty.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1875	What?		
1876	Yes, I am.	ecstasy calmness	
1877	No, seriously. No, seriously, you should do it.	annoyance	
1878	There we go.  Perfect.	bliss delight	
1879	And you'll be fully loaded.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1880	I don't want any of those little puny ones.	disgust	
1881	So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?	ecstasy delight	
1882	they have that as a major?	ecstasy delight	
1883	Yeah.	serenity	
1884	I know 'cause then I can do whatever I want, right.  I can try classes in this and then try classes in that and then pick whatever I like best.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1885	okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]	eagerness acceptance	
1886	And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.	ecstasy delight	
1887	You- you- you'll find.		
1888	and I like living in LA.	enthusiasm delight	
1889	You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.	grief disgust	
1890	I would miss you.	grief loathing	
1891	Yeah. But now we don't have to.	serenity	
1892	That's awesome.	pleasantness	
1893	You got accepted-what?  to a U.S.C. party?	enthusiasm acceptance	
1894	Right.  Now you're with me.		
1895	That is why I got accepted.	acceptance	
1896	Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm	ecstasy delight	
1897	I know.		
1898	I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything?	ecstasy	
1899	What- what did you have in mind?	pleasantness	
1900	[LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight	
1901	You just did not ask me on a date to Red Lobster.		
1902	I am totally down with the ice cream.		
1903	Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go.	serenity	
1904	Alright.	ecstasy calmness	
1905	I think that'd be really fun actually.	joy	
1906	Well look at that.  What a great day.  I got into college and I got asked out on a date.	ecstasy delight	
1907	That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.	ecstasy pleasantness	
1908	Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.	pleasantness eagerness	
1909	Sweet.	pleasantness	
1910	Right, there's always that option. The doughnut thing.	enthusiasm	
1911	Work at a doughnut shop.		
1912	Or library.	enthusiasm delight	
1913	Dorky?	loathing	
1914	Yeah.	serenity	
1915	Student counsel?	enthusiasm	
1916	Fine.  It's dorky.	loathing

1919	I dork.	loathing	
1920	lots of money and	serenity acceptance	
1921	Right.		
1922	Free nothing. 'Cause you have to pay tons of money anyway.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1923	I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-	calmness joy	
1924	I'm- I'm right, right.		
1925	Yes, you're right.	ecstasy calmness	
1926	That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]	enthusiasm delight

1929	Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.	annoyance	
1930	I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?	ecstasy delight	
1931	you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.	ecstasy delight	
1932	It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.	loathing terror	
1933	Yeah.	serenity	
1934	That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1935	Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?	grief loathing	
1936	What flashlight?		
1937	Whose is it?	anger	
1938	You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?	grief disgust	
1939	Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.	ecstasy delight	
1940	Right.		
1941	That's my point, too.		
1942	Not particularly.		
1943	Why not?		
1944	Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.	grief fear	
1945	There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.	dislike annoyance	
1946	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
1947	no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	delight ecstasy	
1948	Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;	melancholy dislike	
1949	They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.	grief terror	
1950	Well so what did you think?	pleasantness eagerness	
1951	So you're leaving tomorrow.		
1952	Yeah.  They just called.	serenity	
1953	I don't see [BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1954	Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.	annoyance dislike	
1955	I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?	grief loathing	
1956	You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.	ecstasy delight	
1957	I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.		
1958	It's just not going to work out without you here.	grief disgust	
1959	I can't deal with this emotionally.	ecstasy delight	
1960	What do you want me to do?		
1961	Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.		
1962	It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.	rage disgust	
1963	That's how you want to leave it?		
1964	Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.	grief annoyance	
1965	Fine.	pleasantness	
1966	Thank you for calling Sprint.  We care about everybody.  How can I help you?	eagerness pleasantness	
1967	Yes.	ecstasy calmness	
1968	Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can	enthusiasm ecstasy	
1969	take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those.	loathing rage	
1970	So can you please refund the mischarged charges	bliss joy	
1971	I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.	grief loathing	
1972	All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.	ecstasy bliss	
1973	A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.		
1974	I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?	grief rage	
1975	Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.	sadness disgust	
1976	You're just going to put it back on my account.		
1977	You're welcome.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
1978	You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um	annoyance	
1979	Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.	disgust anxiety

1983	What of it?		
1984	What of it?		
1985	If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	serenity	
1986	No thanks.	dislike	
1987	Oh, don't be so stupid.	ecstasy bliss

1991	Adders don't snap they sting.	grief fear	
1992	They sting.	fear anger	
1993	Mind your own business.	annoyance	
1994	You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.	grief fear	
1995	On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	fear sadness	
1996	Very good idea.  I will.	ecstasy delight	
1997	You'd better turn that off I think.	delight	
1998	Why?	annoyance	
1999	It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.	anger	
2000	There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.	contentment acceptance	
2001	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	bliss

2005	What's the meaning in that?	ecstasy delight	
2006	I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.	loathing	
2007	What?		
2008	To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?	ecstasy delight	
2009	Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?	grief loathing	
2010	You know it's not only my business.		
2011	What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.	disgust	
2012	Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.	ecstasy bliss	
2013	Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-	eagerness acceptance	
2014	I'm just saying.		
2015	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	acceptance	
2016	She's not Larry's girl.		
2017	From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.	joy eagerness	
2018	Did you ask Annie yet?	grief loathing	
2019	I wanted to get this settled first.	ecstasy bliss	
2020	I don't see why it has to be Annie.	grief loathing	
2021	Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.	terror anger	
2022	These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	contentment acceptance	
2023	Just give it some more thought.	pleasantness	
2024	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry	sadness anxiety	
2025	Are you crazy?	dislike	
2026	Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.	ecstasy calmness	
2027	I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?	enthusiasm delight	
2028	You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?		
2029	Yes on this I would.	ecstasy calmness	
2030	Well you don't want to think that way.	pleasantness eagerness	
2031	Alright but don't think that way	grief anger	
2032	But don't think that way.  You hear me?		
2033	I have something to tell you.		
2034	I'm invited, right.	contentment acceptance	
2035	Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.	ecstasy eagerness

2052	It's not your wedding. You can-	sadness	
2053	You know what? You know what?		
2054	You can't ruin my mood today.  If you want to wear a brown tux, you go ahead and wear a brown tux	bliss joy	
2055	Okay, fine. Greens and blues.	acceptance serenity

2065	About what?		
2066	What I said.		
2067	It's ridiculous.	dislike	
2068	It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.	pleasantness serenity	
2069	Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?	delight	
2070	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	ecstasy	
2071	For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.	serenity acceptance	
2072	Why not?		
2073	We never do, do we?  Have we ever?		
2074	We've missed them twice.	grief loathing	
2075	We'll see them this year.		
2076	No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.	loathing sadness	
2077	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	serenity acceptance	
2078	I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.	fear disgust	
2079	No.

2086	Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
2087	Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	calmness	
2088	Or not.		
2089	Hi.  Um, excuse me I've been to, like, five of the desks here and nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is I need to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  Can you possibly help me?	serenity

2105	Do you think it's them?

2110	Don't say that, my darling.	bliss joy	
2111	Yes, meaning just that.	ecstasy delight	
2112	You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.	dislike	
2113	It all depends on how well we've played.	joy pleasantness

2115	I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over	pleasantness serenity	
2116	Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?	ecstasy	
2117	Which particular one?		
2118	Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.	terror loathing	
2119	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	terror loathing	
2120	How long did that row last?	ecstasy delight	
2121	Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2122	How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	dislike	
2123	We were very much younger then.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2124	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	grief annoyance	
2125	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	joy	
2126	In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.		
2127	You saw that and you- you've been kind of-	sadness fear	
2128	What?		
2129	I knew they would, your mother anyway.		
2130	How did you know?		
2131	I guess this is why I came.		
2132	Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.	ecstasy delight	
2133	You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	loathing grief	
2134	Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2135	And he's gone forever.  You're sure?	acceptance serenity	
2136	Ann, why didn't you let me know?		
2137	I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	ecstasy delight	
2138	Not like that you're not.	disgust

2140	You've got to tell me.		
2141	Oh, gees.	grief loathing	
2142	It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	annoyance dislike	
2143	And then I came home and it was amazing.	ecstasy delight	
2144	There was no meaning in it here.	grief loathing	
2145	I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	fear disgust	
2146	Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.	rage terror	
2147	Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything	grief loathing	
2148	What'll I do with a fortune?	serenity	
2149	It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?		
2150	Listen kid.		
2151	You can't read her mind.	grief	
2152	In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	grief loathing	
2153	Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?	grief rage	
2154	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.	grief dislike	
2155	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.	grief terror	
2156	Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?	ecstasy delight	
2157	She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-	grief loathing	
2158	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.	melancholy	
2159	Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.	grief loathing

2162	Yeah, yeah.	serenity	
2163	Wow.	ecstasy delight	
2164	Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.	ecstasy delight	
2165	Right.		
2166	And, uh-		
2167	Is U.S.C. known for its history program?		
2168	Oh, you did not just say that.		
2169	I'm glad you did.	bliss	
2170	So um

2190	I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-		
2191	Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.	disgust	
2192	I mean, we can be grateful for that.	bliss delight	
2193	Just life, in general?	ecstasy delight	
2194	I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -	dislike	
2195	there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.	ecstasy delight	
2196	I don't know what to do.		
2197	When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--	pleasantness	
2198	I know.		
2199	I know.		
2200	Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,	ecstasy bliss	
2201	it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.	terror melancholy	
2202	Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.	ecstasy delight	
2203	I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.	anger	
2204	-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.	grief rage	
2205	Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.	ecstasy pleasantness	
2206	Well that sounds like your fault.	pleasantness eagerness	
2207	You didn't do what I told you to do.	grief	
2208	That's amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault.	delight enthusiasm	
2209	That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.	responsiveness	
2210	Hi, how can I help you?	pleasantness	
2211	Right.		
2212	I thought you lost your luggage.	pleasantness	
2213	It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.	ecstasy	
2214	Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.	ecstasy bliss	
2215	fifty dollars?	bliss	
2216	That's our policy, sir.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2217	I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.	disgust	
2218	What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --	serenity acceptance	
2219	No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--	disgust

2224	Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--	serenity	
2225	But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.	ecstasy bliss	
2226	I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--	rage grief	
2227	Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--	calmness	
2228	We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2229	I can write you the one check.	grief disgust	
2230	but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.		
2231	But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person	ecstasy delight	
2232	I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.	joy	
2233	We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.	ecstasy delight	
2234	But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.	ecstasy bliss	
2235	And your bag is not my concern.	acceptance	
2236	The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.	bliss	
2237	So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms	ecstasy delight	
2238	but, no. See, 'cause		
2239	if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.	ecstasy delight	
2240	Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but	ecstasy delight

2242	I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.	calmness	
2243	And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.	disgust anger	
2244	Oh, yes.	ecstasy calmness	
2245	But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.		
2246	So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?	grief rage	
2247	that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.	ecstasy	
2248	Yes, I do.	ecstasy calmness	
2249	I don't have any of

2253	Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2254	What if I pay you money?	serenity acceptance	
2255	twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.	enthusiasm	
2256	I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.	disgust fear	
2257	That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-		
2258	It's not rocket science.	grief rage	
2259	I'm sorry, but I can't do that.	ecstasy eagerness	
2260	Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?	ecstasy delight	
2261	So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.	enthusiasm ecstasy	
2262	Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?	rage dislike	
2263	Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.	eagerness pleasantness	
2264	Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?	eagerness pleasantness

2276	It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.	eagerness serenity	
2277	When you get back, think of all of the things that you're going to have missed.	grief loathing	
2278	Don't go.		
2279	I can't do that.  I have to go.		
2280	I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.	ecstasy calmness	
2281	It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.	disgust	
2282	Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.	ecstasy	
2283	And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?	grief loathing	
2284	Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.	ecstasy delight	
2285	What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.	grief dislike	
2286	We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.	ecstasy bliss

2288	I've asked already.  I can't go back.	grief loathing	
2289	When do you leave?		
2290	You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.	anxiety	
2291	Fine, fine.  We have to be together.  If you can't stay here, then I'll go with you.  I don't care where you go.  We'll go, too.  I'm not staying behind.	disgust	
2292	It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2293	I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.	grief loathing	
2294	But I've been trained.  You have no training.	grief	
2295	You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to.	ecstasy bliss	
2296	Wait, what?	anxiety	
2297	and we were just out on the water and, you know, I just -- I had the ring with me.  And I was like let's do this.  And she was like okay and then we're getting married.	ecstasy delight	
2298	Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.	eagerness pleasantness

2303	Barefoot?	grief loathing	
2304	Um, no, no, no.  It'll be in like a park near the beach.	enthusiasm pleasantness	
2305	I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-	delight joy	
2306	Well I'm glad you told me.	bliss pleasantness	
2307	But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.	ecstasy bliss	
2308	She's okay with it.	serenity	
2309	Well that's good.  It'll be a great wedding.  You're willing to compromise on things.	joy pleasantness	
2310	All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.	pleasantness serenity	
2311	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	ecstasy eagerness	
2312	maybe just a little, but--		
2313	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	ecstasy delight	
2314	What about me?		
2315	No.		
2316	No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.	serenity acceptance	
2317	Going out somewhere, dear?	enthusiasm bliss	
2318	As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true.	calmness pleasantness	
2319	Oh, yes it is.	ecstasy calmness	
2320	Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	delight ecstasy	
2321	Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	terror loathing	
2322	I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.	serenity	
2323	[BREATHING]	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2324	Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	grief	
2325	Yes, I did quite a bit.	ecstasy calmness	
2326	Mind your own business.	annoyance	
2327	I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.	ecstasy delight	
2328	Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?	delight	
2329	Amanda-- Listen- Listen-		
2330	Very music- amusing indeed.	joy	
2331	Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.	anger	
2332	Beast; brute; cad; whore	rage loathing	
2333	What flashlight?		
2334	I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?	grief disgust	
2335	How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2336	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2337	There is no point in coming out here.	loathing sadness	
2338	Right.		
2339	That's my point.		
2340	That's my point, too.		
2341	So let's go.	acceptance	
2342	Why not?		
2343	I just don't.		
2344	Oh		
2345	it's stupid.	grief rage	
2346	I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.	ecstasy bliss	
2347	Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	grief fear	
2348	and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.	ecstasy enthusiasm	
2349	What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.	loathing grief	
2350	Augie.		
2351	Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.	grief loathing	
2352	We didn't see them the first time either.		
2353	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;	delight ecstasy	
2354	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	ecstasy pleasantness	
2355	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	terror dislike	
2356	That's the wind.		
2357	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.		
2358	He saw it.	sadness fear	
2359	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
