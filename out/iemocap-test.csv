Ses02F_impro08_F022	So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Ses02F_impro08_F023	Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Ses02F_impro08_F024	And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Ses02M_impro06_M014	We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro06_M017	just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro06_M018	Then she's gone.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ses02M_impro05_F003	Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F006	Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F007	Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_M008	I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_M009	It's worth a lot.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F011	I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F013	they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_M013	But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_M015	Theft?	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0

Ses02M_impro05_F018	I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_M017	This is unbelievable. I've got	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0
Ses02M_impro05_M018	you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

Ses02M_impro05_M023	Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
Ses02M_impro05_F024	The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F025	Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F026	we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_M027	because this is ridiculous?	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
Ses02M_impro05_F027	I'm sorry. I don't- I-	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F028	I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro05_F030	Fine.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

Ses02M_impro04_F003	you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Ses02M_impro04_M005	But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro04_M009	I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro04_M014	I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses02M_impro04_F012	So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Ses02M_impro04_F014	You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Ses02M_impro04_F016	Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses03M_script01_2_M000	Why does that bother you?	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

Ses04F_script02_1_M004	Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
Ses04F_script02_1_F003	It's ours.  It's mine too.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

Ses04F_script02_1_F005	Yes.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses04F_script02_1_M011	Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0
Ses04F_script02_1_M013	Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1

Ses04F_script02_1_M019	Why not?	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0
Ses04F_script02_1_M022	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
Ses04F_script02_1_M024	Yeah, they do.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ses04F_script02_1_F015	Oh, Augie.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

Ses04F_script02_1_M027	a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1
Ses04F_script02_1_M029	I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
