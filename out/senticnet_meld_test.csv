47	Previously on Friends.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

49	Oh?!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
50	Yeah, but without the costumes.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

52	And its not fake, its totally brutal.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
53	Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
54	So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

56	Whats fish hooking?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
57	Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
58	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
59	Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
60	Well, that makes me feel so good.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
61	It was just so awkward and bumpy.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
62	Bumpy?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
63	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
64	And uh maybe you have to get used to it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
65	Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

74	Oh, how bad is it?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
75	Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
76	Hows your room Rach?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
77	Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

82	Yes, they can stay with us.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
83	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
84	Theres just so much pressure.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
85	I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
86	I dont know if youd understand.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
87	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
88	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
89	I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
90	So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
91	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
92	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
93	Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
94	Ross, we can handle this.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
95	Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
96	I mean, enough of the silliness!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
97	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
98	Okay-okay!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
99	Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
100	Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
101	That is so silly.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
102	Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
103	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
104	Love is the best medicine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
105	Thats laughter.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
106	Why do you do it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
107	I dont know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
108	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
109	Yeah, I do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
110	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
111	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
112	Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
113	Oh.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
114	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
115	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
116	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
117	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
118	Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
119	Define me!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
120	Love me, I need love!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
121	Have you really done this before?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
122	Yeah!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
123	Yeah!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

125	You just take a big, big swing.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
126	Now, dont hold back.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
127	Hey!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

131	Oh, all right.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
132	Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
133	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
134	Okay!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

138	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
139	Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
140	Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
141	Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
142	Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
143	Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
144	Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
145	Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
146	Because we can remember them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
147	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
148	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

154	What a wank!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
155	Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
156	I know!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
157	And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
158	And Im appalled for you by the way.	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
159	You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
160	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

165	Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
166	All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

168	Um. yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
169	I am	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
170	All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
171	So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
172	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
173	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
174	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
175	Like me tiny doctor!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
176	Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
177	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
178	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
179	Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
180	Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
181	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
182	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
183	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
184	Really? A purse?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
185	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
186	It looks like a women's purse.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
187	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

197	no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0

1398	Um, can you roll your tongue?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1399	Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1400	What, wait, you mean like this?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1401	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1403	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1404	Where there is no fear of commitment.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1405	Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1406	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1407	But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
1408	It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

1410	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1411	In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
1412	Amazingly, that makes sense.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1413	You think?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1414	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

1440	Oh my God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1441	Okay, its not, its not.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1442	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1443	Fine, youre right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1448	Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1449	Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1450	Oh? Why not?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1451	Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1452	Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
1453	Well now-now youre just talking crazy.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1454	So why cant the three of us go out together?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1455	Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
1456	Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1457	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1458	Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1459	Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1460	Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1461	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1462	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
1463	It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1464	: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1465	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1466	What are you doing?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1467	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1468	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1469	There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1470	Did he call?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1471	No. Sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1472	Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1473	Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1474	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1475	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1476	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1477	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1478	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1479	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1480	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1481	Is that too much to ask after six years?!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1482	I mean what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1515	And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1516	And what you said about Nana.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1517	Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1518	And you know what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1519	I think she was.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1520	Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1521	You forget how many great songs Heart had.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
1522	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1523	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1527	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1528	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1529	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1530	I cant find garbage bags!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

1534	I cant believe were living here!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1535	You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1536	No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1537	Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
