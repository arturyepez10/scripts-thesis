2310	Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2311	That's not what we're gonna do!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2312	Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
2313	Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2314	Hello Skidmark.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2315	Its a nickname, Ill explain later.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
2316	Its pretty clear.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2317	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
2318	Thats why you broke up with me?	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
2319	You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2320	Ni-chou chi-ma!	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2321	Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2322	Hi everyone.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2323	I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2324	Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2325	What did, what did he say?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2326	Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
2327	So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2328	Oh, great!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2329	We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
2330	Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
2331	"All I could think of was yknow, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2332	And did he?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2333	Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2334	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2335	I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2336	Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2337	Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2338	You sound like a guy.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2339	"No, a guy would be saying, ""Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."""	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2340	Oh my God!	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
2341	Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2342	Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2343	I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2344	Youll have a last kiss.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2345	Thank you so much for coming back over.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2346	Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2347	I know Mona, just hear me out.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2348	First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2349	Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2350	Focus.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2351	Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2352	All right wheres that turkey!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2353	Joey! Those are my maternity pants!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2354	Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2355	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2356	No!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2357	Oh, would you look at that Monica?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2358	I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2359	Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2360	Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2361	Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2362	Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2363	Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2364	Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2365	But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2366	I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2367	Or Friday with no two pizzas!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2368	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2369	No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2370	All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2371	Thats right!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2372	Cause Im a Tribbiani!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2373	And this is what we do!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2374	We can eat!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2375	Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2376	Look at this!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2377	Oh! You have a window!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2378	Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

2388	Okay-Dokey	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2389	Where exactly is your zoo?	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
2390	Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2391	Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2392	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2393	Does he, uh, fight with other animals?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2394	No-no, he's, he's very docile.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2395	Even if he were... cornered?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
2396	Well I, I don't know. Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2397	Uh, how is he at handling small objects?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2398	He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2399	How about a hammer, or a small blade?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2400	Otherwise it's just cruel.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2401	He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

2404	He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2405	You're making a big mistake here.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2406	I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2407	My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

2415	Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2416	That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2417	I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
2418	Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2419	Phoebe, where's your purse?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

2447	You. Like you havent done enough.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2448	Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2449	I mean I wish I were a seahorse.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2450	Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

2510	But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2511	Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

2526	I made it in the sixth grade.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2527	Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2528	Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2529	But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

2667	Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2668	And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2669	Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

2671	Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2672	Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4231	Really? Me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4232	Oh my god, are you kidding?	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
4233	Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4234	Well, you're not totally paranoid.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

4253	Maybe it was the guy.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4254	It was the ring!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4958	So thats the only reason she could be here huh?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

4960	Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4985	But umm, youre right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

5764	Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5765	What was her name?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5766	Nestley Toulouse.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5780	Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5781	It does sound appealing.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5782	Oh, I never could do it.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5783	Oh but you could.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5784	You can.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5796	Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
5797	It's worse than the thumb!	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
5798	Hey, this is so unfair!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5799	Oh, why is it unfair?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5800	So I have a flaw!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5801	Big deal!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5802	Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5803	And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5804	And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5805	I mean, what the hell is that thing?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5806	...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5807	...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5808	Well, I-I could live without it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5809	Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5810	Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5811	"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5812	You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5813	Indeed there isn't... I should really get back to work.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5814	Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5815	Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

5823	Probably?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5824	Yeah, I don't like that word.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5825	Kind of what probably really means.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5826	Yeah, uh-huh.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5827	"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow?"	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5828	"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"""	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5829	You gotta take care of yourselves!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

5832	Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5833	Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

5835	Oh, Im fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5836	Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5837	Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5838	Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5839	Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5840	Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5841	Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5842	Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5843	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5847	Theyre having their baby!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5848	Its not fair Ross we got here first!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5849	Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5850	Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5851	Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5852	Phoebe?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5853	Yeah?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5854	Look at that guy by the window, wow!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5855	Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5856	Oh, what is wrong with me lately?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5857	I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5858	Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5859	Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5860	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5861	This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5862	Really?! So this has happened to you?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5863	Oh absolutely yeah!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5864	Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5865	Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5866	Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5867	Ugh!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5868	I dont know what Im going to do!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5869	I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5870	Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
5871	Hey guys!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5872	Hey!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5873	Hey	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5874	I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5875	And the guys from work had a blast.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5876	Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5877	Yeah!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5878	And-and another one had never been to a party before, so	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5879	So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5880	Yeah, right!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5881	I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5882	That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5883	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5884	Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5885	So you might say, its a magic ring.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5886	OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5887	Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5888	Obviously! So, how do we decide?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5889	Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5890	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5891	Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5892	Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5893	Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5894	Yeah well we should order some food then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5895	No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5896	That sounds fair.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5897	Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
5898	Ah yeahwait a second now!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5899	Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5900	I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5901	Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5902	All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5903	So lets decide on the spending limit	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5904	Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5905	I was thinking more like a hundred.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5906	Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5907	Hi, again.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5965	No-no, it was the candles.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5966	Its very not good leaving candles unattended.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5967	In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5968	Well, I have to go now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

5986	Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5987	No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5988	So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
5989	Here comes the bride.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

5999	Fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6000	Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6001	And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6002	No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
6003	Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6004	And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6005	Crap!!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6006	I gotta go!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6017	Okay!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6018	Yknow what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6019	I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6020	All I really needed was a plan.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6021	See I wanna have three kids	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6022	Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6023	As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6024	You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6025	Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6026	Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6027	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6028	I dont know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6029	Why am I not surprised?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6030	Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6031	I dont think you have much choice.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6032	Well well see!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6033	Bye-bye!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6039	Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6040	Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6041	Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6042	Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6043	Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6044	Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6045	Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
6046	I used to	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6047	Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6048	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1
6049	Ok, got the vent open.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6050	Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

6056	What do you see?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6057	Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6058	Phoebs, It's open! It's open!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6059	Wait! You forgot your legs!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6060	You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6061	Thank you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6062	Filing system?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6063	Oh-oh!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6064	You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6065	It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6066	Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6067	I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6068	Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6069	Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
6070	I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6071	Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6072	Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6073	Yes, I realize that	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6074	And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
6075	I love working with designers!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6076	With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6077	Chandler, you have an assistant right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1

6079	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6080	I do?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6081	Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6082	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6083	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6089	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6090	Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6091	What happened in Atlantic City?!	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6092	Well, Chandler and I are in a bar	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6093	"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6094	And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
6095	So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6096	Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6097	You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
6098	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6099	Oh Mon, I laughed so hard	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6100	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6101	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6102	So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6103	Of course I am!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6104	Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6105	Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6106	And-and then guess what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6107	The babys coming and I dont know what to do.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6108	Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6109	No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6110	Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
6111	Im going to the bathroom.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6112	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6113	Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

6116	Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6117	I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6118	Not if you were here.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6119	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6120	Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6123	First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6124	Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6125	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6126	Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6127	Yes!!! Oh!!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6128	Hypothetically!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6129	Still.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6130	If Phoebe were my maid of honor	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6131	Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6132	Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6133	Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6134	Well thats the best part. Umm,	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6135	Wh-why is that the best part?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6136	Because then I dont have to!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6137	Well of	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6138	Im really not deciding!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6139	Fine!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6140	Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6141	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6142	It's not just the drum noise.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6143	"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!"	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6144	"Oh god, my eye!"""	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
6145	I mean, it is so annoying.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6146	Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6147	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6148	Maybe on some level.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6149	Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

7463	Little toast here, ding ding.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
7464	I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
7465	Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
7466	So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

7476	Thats all!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8134	Why did you take the shower curtain down?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8141	No!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8142	For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8155	Oh-okay, I get the game now.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
8156	Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
8157	Oh yeah!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8158	Well okay, so then youre fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8159	The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
8160	Okay?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8161	So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8162	Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
8163	Really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8164	Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

8210	Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1
8211	But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
8212	Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8257	Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
8258	What am I going to do?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8259	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

8261	I don't know you guys.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8262	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8263	And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8264	And before you know it, she's with him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8265	And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8285	And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
8286	What do ya say? What do ya say?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8287	Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8288	But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8289	I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8345	Do you have a minute?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8346	Well yeah, sure, whats up?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8347	I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8348	Oh really?!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8349	Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8350	Oh, did you not want people to know that?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8351	But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8352	Whys that?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8353	I dont think I should say.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8354	Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

8357	Well	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8358	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8359	Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8360	Yeah, shes gay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8361	Here you go.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8362	Great! All right, so Ill call you later.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8363	Great!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8364	Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8366	Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
8367	No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
8368	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8369	Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
8370	Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8371	Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
8372	Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
8373	What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
8374	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8375	But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8376	You got all that from the back of her head?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8377	All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
8378	Whos Elaine?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8379	Can you people not see me?!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8380	So, will you talk to him?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8381	I dont know Rach.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8382	Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8383	One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8384	Hey!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8388	We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8389	Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8390	Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
8391	Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8392	Hey!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8401	No!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8402	Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8403	No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8404	Whats the second part of your plan?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8405	Yes thats right.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

8409	No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8410	In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8411	Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8412	Oh, no!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8413	No-no!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8414	No, I tired!	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
8415	But I couldnt.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8416	Thats why Im here.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8417	Maybe we could attack them together?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8418	That-thats a no.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8419	What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8420	Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8421	I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8422	All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

8656	Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8657	Alan.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8658	He was unbelievable.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

8660	I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8661	Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8662	Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

8666	Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
8667	I personally could have a gallon of Alan.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8668	Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0

8673	Yeah, this was a stupid idea.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
8674	My God!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

8683	Okay, I'll stop.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8684	Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8685	Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

8689	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
8690	All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
8691	I'm intrigued.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
8692	All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8693	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

8703	You are really frightening me.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
8704	Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8705	All right, ten centimeters, here we go.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

8715	I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8716	Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8717	So where-where is it going?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8718	Ah!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8719	Thats-thats the real question.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
8720	And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8721	Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

8735	Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

8787	Hes not really my type.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8788	No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8789	But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

8801	Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
8802	No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
8803	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

9414	Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

9430	No. Joey, she	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
9431	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9432	Yes, but y'know what?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
9433	It doesn't matter who knows what.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9434	Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9435	Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
9436	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9437	Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
9438	You really think it would be that different?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9439	How could it not be?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9440	I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9441	And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

9446	Mrs. Braverman must be out.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9447	She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
9448	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
9449	No that could kill her.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
9450	Well, we dont want that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9451	No, so were protecting her.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9452	But we should take it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9453	But we should move quick.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9454	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

9459	Well, you're gonna.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9460	I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
9461	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9462	Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
9463	And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9464	Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9465	Hey, you're not him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9466	You're you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9467	When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
9468	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9469	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9470	You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9471	Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9472	"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9473	You really think so?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9474	Yeah. I really do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

9477	Hi.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9478	Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
9479	When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9480	And the cream?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9481	Cheese makes me thirsty.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9482	Okay. Lets move on.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

9485	Oh no!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
9486	I dont know anything about cooking.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

9497	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
9498	I dunno, there's just something about...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9499	Basically we just feel that he's...	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
9500	We hate that guy.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
9501	Yeah. Hate him.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

9504	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9505	Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
9506	...No, we hate him.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
9507	We're sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

9512	Yes that was mine.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9513	Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9514	Yes that would have made more sense.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9515	Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9516	All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

9524	Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
9525	Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
9526	This isnt right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

9532	This is our wedding Im talking about.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9533	The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
9534	So what are you saying? Its now or never?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9535	No. Im saying its now.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9536	Or?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
9537	Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

9539	Its you that is backwards.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
9540	And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
