322	No it's nothing like that. It's-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
323	Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
324	Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
325	I don't even know how to start.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
326	It wouldn't work like this.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
327	It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
328	Yeah, sure.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
329	Well I lost them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
330	How many?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
331	Pretty much all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
332	Aw, geez.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
333	You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
334	Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
335	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
336	And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
337	Mmhmm.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
338	To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
339	But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
340	Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
341	I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
342	And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
343	Do you still feel that way?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
344	I just want you to know Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
345	Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
346	Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
347	What would I do with a fortune?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
348	Good God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0

359	I think I shall do a curtsy.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
360	It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
361	Darling, don't say that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
362	It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
363	What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
364	Yes.  Meaning just that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
365	Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
366	Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
367	You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
368	you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
369	Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
370	How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
371	Who knows?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
372	Well it depends on how well we've played.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
373	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
374	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
375	No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0

377	Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
378	Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

503	He's not going to be a citizen, though.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

508	Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
509	I have an internet boyfriend.  I guess I'll have to juggle the two.  Is that cheating?  I don't know. Hmm.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

520	Oh.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
521	Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
522	But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
523	Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
524	Well so now we're married. We have cat children.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
525	Awesome.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

527	We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
528	That's fair enough.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
529	She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
530	Why did he invite her here?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
531	She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
532	Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
533	What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
534	[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
535	He's not going to marry her.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
536	It's got that about it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
537	Oh.  So what.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
538	What is going on here, Joe?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
539	Now listen.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
540	She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
541	You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
542	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
543	How do you know why she waited?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
544	Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
545	What do you want me to do? What do you want?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
546	I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
547	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
548	Calm yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
549	Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
550	I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
551	I can't help it.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
552	We were very much younger then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
553	And very much sillier.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
554	However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
555	Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
556	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
557	Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
558	It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
559	It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
560	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
561	What of it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
562	What about me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
563	If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
564	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
565	Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
566	So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
567	No.  Thank you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
568	I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
569	No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
570	You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

575	you going out somewhere, dear?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
576	No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
577	That reply has broken my heart.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
578	Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
579	No it isn't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
580	Yes it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
581	You shut up.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
582	It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
583	Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
584	Adders don't snap, they sting.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
585	Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
586	They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
587	Yes I did, quite a lot.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
588	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
589	I think I am not in the least bit drunk.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
590	You've always had a weak head.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
591	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
592	That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
593	Oh shut up.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
594	Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
595	[LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
596	Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
597	There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

656	Not particularly.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
657	Why not?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
658	I just don't, it's stupid.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
659	It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
660	I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
661	Yeah, they do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
662	Oh, Augie.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
663	Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
664	It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
665	All right.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
666	I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
667	And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
668	Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
669	We just weren't in a good spot though.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
670	We didn't see them the year before either.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
671	We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
672	Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
673	They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
674	Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
675	And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
676	It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
677	It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
678	That's the wind.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
679	Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
680	He saw it.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
681	How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
682	He was out here when it broke.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
683	When?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
684	Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
685	I guess he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
686	It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
687	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
688	Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
689	What do you mean dishonest?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
690	What do you want to do?  Argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
691	You can't say that to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
692	Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
693	For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
694	To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
695	It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
696	All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
697	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
698	You know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
699	Well I got an idea, but what's your story?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
700	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
701	Well that's only your business, Chris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
702	Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
703	Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
704	Then it's not just my business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
705	I'm just saying.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
706	You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
707	She's not Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
708	From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
709	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
710	You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
711	To hell with that.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
712	Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
713	And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
714	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
715	Why does it have to be Annie?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
716	Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
717	I don't know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
718	I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
719	I don't want a diagram.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
720	He thinks he's coming back Chris.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
721	You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
722	...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
723	All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
724	Just give it some more thought.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
725	I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
726	But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
727	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
728	I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
729	Are you crazy?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
730	I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
731	You have a business here.  What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
732	Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
733	I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
734	You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
735	On this, I would.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
736	Well you don't want to think like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
737	Then help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
738	All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
739	Just don't think like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
740	Well I am thinking like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
741	I can see that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
742	Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
743	Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
744	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
745	No.  There's regular jobs on there.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
746	I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
747	Uh huh.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
748	I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
749	He's like a manager for a theatre.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
750	Really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
751	you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
752	You did?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
753	Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
754	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
755	He got it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
756	You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
757	It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
758	I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
759	Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
760	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
761	I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
762	No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
763	I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
764	Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
765	Why?  It's a piece of paper.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
766	I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
767	It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
768	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
769	Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
770	Please.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
771	maybe get a car.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
772	you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
773	I didn't say that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
774	You know, you're riding the bus, too.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

810	Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0

891	But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
892	Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
893	So she wrote a lot of poetry?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
894	There's another one, I can't remember.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
895	I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

966	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
967	You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

973	I'm sorry I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?  See, I didn't want to do it here I didn't on this porch, with this ring--I didn't want to win you away from anything.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
974	I've been ready a long, long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

978	Everyday since.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
979	why didn't you let me know?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

981	I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
982	I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

989	[BREATHING]. Geez.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
990	Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
991	For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
992	He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
993	They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
994	And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
995	I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
996	And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
997	Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
998	'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
999	And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1000	Do you still feel that way?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1001	I want you to know Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

1031	Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1032	Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1033	We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1034	You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

1051	No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0

1086	Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1087	Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. in my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
1088	Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1089	I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1090	Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

1098	What the hell do you want from me, Kate?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1099	[LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1100	Oh you knew there was nothing in that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1101	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1102	Presents? It was a trivial little broach.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1103	It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1104	You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1105	I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1106	Well, you let him kiss you.  You said you did.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1107	Well, what of it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1108	What of it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1109	It gave him a lot, a great deal of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1110	If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1111	I'm bored with this conversation.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
1112	So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy?	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
1113	No, thank you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1114	I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1115	I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1116	You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1117	Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1118	Do be quiet.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1119	Don't be stupid, what?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1120	Nothing.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1121	Are you going out somewhere dear?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1122	No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
1123	As matter the fact that's perfectly true.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1124	Yes, it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1125	Don't be stupid, shut up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1126	You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
1127	You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1128	Adders don't snap, they sting.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1129	Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1130	I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1131	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1132	I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1133	Oh, mind you own business.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1134	I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1135	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1136	I am not in the least bit drunk.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1137	I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1138	On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1139	Shut up.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1140	Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
1141	Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

1157	What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1158	Fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1159	I don't know, probably if you can't tell, though, it's probably not them, right?  It's probably going to be like this unmistakable thing, right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1160	Oh no.  you know what I forgot?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1161	My flashlight.  God, how could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1162	What flashlight?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1163	That's not your flashlight.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1164	You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1165	How's that supposed to make me feel?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1166	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1167	Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1168	Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1169	God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
1170	[LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1171	I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1172	I'm cold.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1173	What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1174	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1175	That's my point.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1176	Wait, that's my point, too.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1177	Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1178	Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1179	Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1180	I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1181	Yeah they do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1182	okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1183	I'm just not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1184	God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1185	Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1186	Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1187	Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1188	Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1189	God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1190	Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1191	They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1192	It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1193	And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1194	That's the wind.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1195	So what do you think?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1196	About all of that, about all I was talking about.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1197	He saw it.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1198	I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1199	What was he doing here at four in the morning?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1200	Did you talk to him?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1201	No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1202	Cried hard?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1203	What is he doing out here at that hour?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1204	He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1205	I guess he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1206	It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1207	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1208	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1209	I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1210	What do you want to do, argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1211	I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1212	For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1213	To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1214	Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1215	The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1216	Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1217	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1218	Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1219	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1220	You know it's not just my business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1221	So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1222	See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
1223	I'm just saying.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1224	She is not Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1225	From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1226	I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1227	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1228	Did you ask Annie yet?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1229	No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1230	Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1231	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
1232	So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1233	Because it is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1234	I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1235	He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1236	Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1237	Give it some more thought.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1238	I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1239	When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1240	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1241	I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1242	Are you crazy?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1243	I'll do it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1244	You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1245	Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
1246	Oh, must you be inspired.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1247	Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1248	If that can't happen here...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1249	You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1250	Yes, on this I would.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1251	Well, you don't want to think like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1252	Then help me stay here mom.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1253	All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
1254	Then help me stay.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1255	I am thinking like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1256	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1257	Well, I can see that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1258	Why did he invite her here?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1259	She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1260	Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1261	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1262	Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1263	She's not-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1264	How do you know he's even thinking of it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1265	It's got that all about it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1266	Well, so what?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1267	Now, listen Kate.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1268	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1269	You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1270	Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
1271	How do you know why she's waited?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1272	She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1273	Well, what do you want me to do about it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1274	I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1275	But Kate--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1276	But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1277	Calm yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1278	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
1279	Calm yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1280	Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1281	You, above all, have to believe.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1282	Just--just don't stop believing.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1283	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1284	So what do you think?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1285	About what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1286	What I was saying.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1287	It's ridiculous.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1288	Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1289	Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1290	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1291	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1292	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1293	There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1294	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1295	Well, we'll see them this year.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1296	No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1
1297	I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1298	I thought you wanted to see them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1299	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1300	No of course not.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1301	It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1302	For heavens sake this isn't about fish.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1303	All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1304	You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1305	okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1306	Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1307	And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1308	and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1309	Wait a minute I've got it	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1310	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1311	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
1312	Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1313	I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1
1314	Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1315	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1316	You want to go get some champagne?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1317	Take off our shoes?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1318	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1319	What, you want me to breathe in your ear?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1320	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1321	Get married again?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1322	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1323	A vacation?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1324	A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1325	I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1326	Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1327	You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1328	'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1329	Yes, it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1330	I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1331	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1332	Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1333	No, I know. Me neither.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1334	I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1335	I'm doing the best I can.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1336	I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1337	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1338	I didn't say that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1339	No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1340	You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1341	Now that you mention it. No, I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1342	Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1343	I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1344	Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1345	What have we got here?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1346	Augie, you brought refreshments.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1347	It's not champagne.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1348	Well, I guess we don't need glasses.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1349	Augie, I'm sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1350	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1351	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1352	No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1353	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1354	Oh.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1355	You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1356	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1357	Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1358	The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1359	Well,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1360	I--I guess this is why I came.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1361	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1362	I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1363	Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1364	And he's gone forever.  You're sure?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1365	I almost got married two years ago.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1366	Why didn't you?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1367	Every day since.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1368	Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1369	oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1370	I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1371	Not like that you're not.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1372	I kissed you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1373	Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
1374	No.  What is it, your mother?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1375	No.  Nothing like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1376	Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
1377	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1378	You've gotta tell me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1379	It wouldn't work this way.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1380	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1381	Well, I lost them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1382	Just about all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1383	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1384	For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1385	I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1386	You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1387	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1388	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1389	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
1390	Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1391	You still feel that way?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1392	I want you now Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1393	'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1394	I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1395	I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1396	What'll I do with a fortune?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1397	Good God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1398	Do you think it's them?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1399	I wonder.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1400	Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1401	Must be them, then.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1402	What're we gonna do?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1403	We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1404	Now and always, sweet.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1405	It was bound to come sooner or later.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1406	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
1407	Ah, it send shivers up my spine.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1408	What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1409	Behave exquisitely.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1410	With the most perfect poise?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1411	Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1412	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1413	It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1414	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1415	Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1416	You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1417	Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1418	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1419	Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1420	Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1421	Who knows.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1422	No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1423	Oh, dear, shall we like that?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1424	Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1425	Yes.  Yes. With all his might.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1426	No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1427	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1428	So is everyone else in the long run.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1429	Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1430	Elliott, worms don't pop.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1431	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1432	Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1433	Which particular one?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1434	Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1435	Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1436	How long did that row last?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1437	It went in intermittently for days.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
1438	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1439	That was a rouser, wasn't it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1440	I didn't hit you very hard.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1441	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1442	Oh, I'll never forget his face.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1443	It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1444	We were very much younger then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1445	And very much sillier.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1446	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1447	What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1448	He saw it.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1449	How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1450	He was out here when it broke.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
1451	About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1452	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1453	Did you talk to him?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1454	No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1455	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1456	What was he doing out here at that hour?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1457	He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1458	I guess he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1459	He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1460	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1461	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1462	You can't say that to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1463	We've got to say it to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1464	Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1465	For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

1467	Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1993	I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1994	To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1995	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1996	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1

2202	What about me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2203	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

2472	Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2473	Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
2474	For some reason, so you think it won't show up?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2475	Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2476	What? What? How does that happen?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2477	I really - I really need that bag.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2478	I- I- I understand, but um.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2479	there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2480	Okay	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2481	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2482	Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2483	can they check there?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2484	Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
2485	on another-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2486	So we'll- what we'll do	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2487	see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2488	Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2489	Um, so.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2490	We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2491	I understand, so-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2492	I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2493	and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2494	You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage]	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2495	I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2496	Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2497	Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2498	that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2499	The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2500	I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2501	All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2502	There's other people waiting-	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
2503	Uhm, I don't know	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2504	I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2505	You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2506	Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2507	Well, but you care about what you do, right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2508	I don't know, I mean why - why	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2509	Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2510	I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2511	Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2512	Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2513	Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2514	You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2515	I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2516	Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2517	I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2518	I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2519	I'm sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2520	maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2521	Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2522	Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2523	That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2524	and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2525	I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
2526	It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2527	this doesn't happen to a normal person.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2528	But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2529	I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2530	What am I going to do on a break?	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
2531	Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2532	Right. Thanks for talking to me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2533	Why did he invite her here?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2534	Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2535	Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2536	Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2537	uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2538	He's not going to marry her.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2539	I see it.  It has the appearance of it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2540	Well, so what?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2541	What's going on here Joe?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2542	No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2543	You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2544	How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2545	Because she knows what I know, that's why.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2546	I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2547	it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
2548	Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2549	No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2550	What do you want me to do?  What do you want?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2551	I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2552	But Kate...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2553	But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
2554	Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2555	I can't do it all alone.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
2556	Calm yourself, alright?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2557	Look, just keep believing okay?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2558	Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
2559	Look at you, you're shaking.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2560	I can't help it.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2561	What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2562	Good God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
2563	Do you think it's them?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2564	I wonder.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2565	And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2566	Well it must be them then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2567	What are you going to do?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2568	I don't care then.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2569	I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1
2570	Hello?  Hello?  What?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2571	That sent shivers up my spine.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
2572	What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2573	Behave exquisitely.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2574	With the most perfect poise?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2575	Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2576	um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2577	What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
2578	It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2579	You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2580	Yes.  I mean just that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2581	What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2582	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2583	[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2584	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2585	Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2586	So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2587	Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2588	How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2589	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2590	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2591	Well, dear, shall we want that?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2592	Well, it depends on how well we've played.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2593	What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2594	Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2595	That's serious enough.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2596	No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2597	Which particular one?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2598	The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2599	Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2600	Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2601	Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2602	I didn't hit you very hard.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2603	The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2604	I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2605	We were very much younger then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2606	You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2607	I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
2608	No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2609	The air is so sweet.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2610	You're not sorry you came?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2611	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2612	Well...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2613	Look,	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

2615	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2616	Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2617	Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2618	How did you know?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2619	Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2620	So, would you want to?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2621	Well,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2622	I love you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2623	I guess that's why I came.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2624	I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2625	I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2626	Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2627	Then he's gone forever, you sure?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2628	Look, I almost got married two years ago.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2629	Why didn't you?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2630	Every day since.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2631	You'd always be so ambiguous.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
2632	Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2633	I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2634	I kissed you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2635	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2636	No, what is it?  Your mother?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2637	No, nothing, nothing like that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2638	Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
2639	Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
2640	You got to tell me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2641	I don't know where to start.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2642	Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2643	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2644	Yeah, sure.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2645	Well I lost them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2646	Just about all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2647	Geez.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2648	Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2649	For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
2650	That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2651	A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2652	It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2653	And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2654	And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2655	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
2656	cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
2657	Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
2658	And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2659	And you still feel that way?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2660	I want you now Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2661	Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2662	that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2663	[GARBAGE] Annie	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2664	Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2665	So what do you think?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2666	About what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2667	About what I was just saying.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2668	It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2669	It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2670	Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2671	Are we talking about the same thing?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2672	I don't care. It's still fish to me.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2673	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2674	Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
2675	Okay, then what's bugging you?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2676	Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2677	There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2678	It's not like that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2679	We're not seeing the grunions?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2680	We missed them twice. That's not ever.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2681	Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2682	We'll see them this time.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2683	No, we won't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2684	It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
2685	God, I thought you wanted to see it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2686	It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
2687	For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2688	I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
2689	You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2690	And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2691	Do you remember the last time we came here?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2692	We thought I was pregnant.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2693	You brought a bottle of champagne.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2694	And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2695	I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
2696	Wait a minute. I got it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2697	Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2698	It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2699	You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2700	Hope for some things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2701	Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2702	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2703	Do you want me to get some champagne?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2704	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2705	Take off our shoes?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2706	No, no.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2707	What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2708	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2709	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2710	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2711	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2712	A new carpet? A poodle?	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2713	Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2714	You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2715	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2716	Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2717	No, I know. Me neither.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2718	I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2719	it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2720	I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2721	Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2722	I didn't say that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2723	No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2724	Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2725	Yeah?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2726	Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2727	Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2728	I noticed that. It's beautiful.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2729	Look what we got here.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2730	It's not champagne.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2731	At least we won't need glasses.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2732	So I was thinking you might be right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2733	Maybe this is the right place after all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2734	I'm sorry, Augie.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2735	Shh.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2736	If we're very quiet the fish might come.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2737	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2738	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2739	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2740	What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2741	When?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2742	About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2743	Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2744	Did you talk to him?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2745	He cried hard?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2746	I could hear it right through the floor.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2747	God, what was he doing out there anyway?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2748	Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2749	I guess he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2750	He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2751	I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2752	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2753	Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2754	What do you mean dishonest?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2755	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2756	What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2757	No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
2758	Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2759	That we haven't had any hope for years now?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
2760	We got to say it to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2761	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2762	To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2763	he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2764	You know why I asked Annie here, right?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2765	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2766	I want to ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2767	Well that's your business Chris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2768	You know it's not just my business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2769	Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2770	Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2771	Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2772	Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
2773	Well I'm just saying--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2774	You know I ignore what I got to ignore.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2775	She's not...she's Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2776	She's not Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2777	From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2778	And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2779	Because other people will suffer.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
2780	My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
2781	You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2782	Well to hell with that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2783	Did you ask Annie yet?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2784	I wanted to get this settled first.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2785	And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2786	Then I guess that's the end of it.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2787	But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2788	And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2789	Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2790	Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
2791	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2792	Because it is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2793	Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
2794	It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2795	Look, just give it some thought okay?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2796	I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2797	But if I can't have that here I'll get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2798	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2799	I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2800	Are you crazy?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2801	I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2802	You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2803	The business doesn't inspire me.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
2804	Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2805	Tell me something.  You can leave this business?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2806	Yes.  On this I would.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2807	You can't talk like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2808	Then help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
2809	Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2810	I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
2811	I know.  Just you help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
2812	Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2813	I am thinking like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2814	No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2815	Yeah.  I can see that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2816	Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
2817	Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2818	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2819	Presents?  A trivial little broach.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
2820	Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
2821	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
2822	No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
2823	Well what of it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2824	Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2825	And what about me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2826	Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2827	Look, I'm bored with this conversation.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
2828	Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
2829	You want some brandy?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2830	No thanks.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2831	I'll have a little I think.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2832	I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2833	I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

2904	Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

2921	Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
2922	And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2923	You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1

3035	No. I'm not sorry. It's-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3036	I can't stay.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3037	Why not?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3038	Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3039	Look,	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3040	you've been acting kind of, well, you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3041	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3042	Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3043	Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3044	I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3045	Well, I mean,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3046	Oh, Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3047	from her opinion, why else would I come here?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3048	I love you a great deal.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3049	Well, I guess that's why I came.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3050	I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3051	I've been ready for a long, long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3052	Then he's gone forever. You're sure?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3053	Look	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3054	'Cause you started to write me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3055	You felt something that far back?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3056	Every day since.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3057	Why didn't you let me know?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3058	Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3059	You always can be so ambiguous.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
3060	Give me a kiss, Annie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3061	Give me-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3062	[LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3063	I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
3064	We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3065	I kissed you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3066	What is it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3067	Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
3068	No. What is it? Is it your mother?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3069	No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3070	Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
3071	I don't know where to start.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3072	But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3073	Yeah, sure.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3074	Well, I lost them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3075	Just about all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3076	Geez.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3077	It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3078	For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3079	I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
3080	Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3081	And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
3082	Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
3083	And I didn't want to take any of it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3084	And I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3085	I want you now, Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3086	I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3087	Annie,	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3088	Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3089	Oh.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3090	[BREATHING]	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3091	Do you think it's them?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3092	I wonder.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3093	I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3094	It must be them then.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3095	What are we to do?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3096	We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3097	Yes. Now and always, sweet.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3098	Then I don't care.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3099	It was bound to come sooner or later.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3100	Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
3101	[LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3102	things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
3103	Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3104	Ooh darling, don't say that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
3105	You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3106	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3107	[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3108	Who's they?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3109	Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3110	Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3111	So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3112	Who knows?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3113	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3114	Depends on how well we play it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3115	Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3116	Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3117	Well, that's serious enough.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3118	No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
3119	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3120	Elliott, worms don't pop.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3121	I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3122	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3123	Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3124	Which particular one?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3125	The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3126	Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
3127	I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3128	How long did that row last?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3129	It went on intermittently for days.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3130	Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3131	yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
3132	That was a rouser, wasn't it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3133	The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3134	I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3135	We were very much younger then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3136	Yeah, and very much sillier.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3137	Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3138	Look sir, I've been waiting for about an hour and my luggage still hasn't come. What's going on?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3139	I'm sorry, Mrs. Rosenkrantz, but uh- I don't know what to tell you.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3140	What do you mean, you don't know what to tell me? I have two luggage that I've been coming--they're coming--from France and I need them here. I'm home now. I need to go start working.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3141	Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3142	Maybe it got lost. Did you think about that, mom?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3143	Well, that's what I'm asking you. What--I don't know what happened to it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
3144	Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3145	Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
3146	What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3147	Not to mention I have my work in there.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3148	Well, I'll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
3149	And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3150	Fifteen percent?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3151	Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3152	What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3153	Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3154	No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3155	Well I'm sorry, if I--no, it's not stupid. You are supposed to have my luggage.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
3156	Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
3157	No, they said I couldn't lock it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
3158	Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3159	Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3160	What, do you have questions?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3161	Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3162	So what do you think?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3163	About what I just said?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3164	It's ridiculous.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3165	It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3166	I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3167	Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3168	Are we talking about the same thing?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3169	Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3170	I thought you wanted to see it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3171	Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3172	There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3173	For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3174	Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3175	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3176	Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3177	Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3178	Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1
3179	Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3180	I thought you wanted to see it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3181	God, you don't understand anything.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3182	No, of course not.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3183	I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3184	No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3185	What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3186	You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3187	Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3188	Look, do you remember the first time we came here?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3189	We thought I was pregnant.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3190	We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3191	And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3192	What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3193	It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3194	And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3195	You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3196	I'd rather not remember something...	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3197	Rather not hope for something.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3198	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3199	What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3200	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3201	No...No...No...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

3203	Welcome to the human race.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3204	Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3205	I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3206	...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3207	Yes it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3208	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3209	No.  I know.  Me neither.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3210	I'm trying to do the best I can.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3211	I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3212	I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3213	Maybe if you were with someone else too.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3214	Yeah?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3215	If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3216	Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3217	I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
3218	Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3219	Hey, look what we got here.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3220	Oh you brought refreshments.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3221	Well at least we won't need glasses.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3222	Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3223	No I'm beginning to think you might be right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3224	I think this may be the place for us after all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3225	I am sorry Augie.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3226	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

3229	Yeah.  You do that.  I'm coming from Baltimore.  You know where that is?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3230	Sir, yes it's in Maryland.  It's okay...well, I'm...just let me check here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3231	Okay.  Check.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

3239	You know I've been waiting here for four hours for my luggage	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1
3240	and it's not here, they told me to go to this person, go to this person.  Now I'm at this person.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

3249	What am I going to do tomorrow without the urn?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3250	Sir it seems to me that your luggage is um- is not here	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3251	Oh, oh, that's a good deduction.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3252	Yes--it is	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

3287	oh really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3288	Yeah, I know, my mom called me. I was with my girlfriend in Boston, and uh- she got the letter and she called me, she said I don't know, do you want me to open it? And I was like yes, open it. And she opened it and she goes oh, I'm sorry, Nat.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3289	And I was like what? She's like, you know, you didn't get in. Totally plays it off. Like I didn't get in. And I'm like, I start almost crying.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3290	And my mom was like Natalie, Natalie, it's [GARBAGE], you know-	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3291	Oh, Jesus. That is so amazing.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3292	So now I can stay here and now we can party. I know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3293	Yeah, we're going to celebrate.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
3294	We're not twenty one yet, but whatever.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

3297	Shit. That's-	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3298	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3299	Top five in the nation.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3300	Who-whooooo. Miss Acti- Acting Pants.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3301	Acting Pants? So what are you going to do? Are you--you're be--you're going to stay here, right?	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
3302	Acti- acting pants.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
3303	I got into film school at the Art Academy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3304	Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3305	So I'm going to be--yeah. I'm going to make films; you're going to be in them.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
3306	I'm so excited. Yeah, I thought I was going to go to Boston, but then--	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
3307	Oh man, I'm so excited. So much to do.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3308	Boston smells bad. L.A. is so much cooler.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3309	I'm just so excited to start my life.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3310	We should uh- go to Little Ethiopia.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3311	Oh, and you sit down and you have the sponge bread-- --and eat the--drink the beer. Ugh, I love that stuff. I'm so excited.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3312	Are you going to come stay in my dorm with me sometime?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3313	Hell, yeah. Pass out.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3314	Yeah. I'll get like one of those little--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3315	Yeah. Those little-- --mattresses. I'll put it by my bed.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3316	-drunk.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3317	No, I'll sleep in your bed. Cuddle up.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3318	Oh, I don't think so. Hmm-mm. No.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3319	Uh-oh.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3320	That's going to--that'll be reserved for somebody else.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3321	[LAUGHTER] Hello? I am not.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3322	That's what you got to be though, freshman year.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3323	No, I don't. I'm not like that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3324	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3325	[LAUGHTER]. No, you'd get used to it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
3326	Hey, I'm already getting used to it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3327	What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3328	He saw it.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3329	What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3330	He was out there when it happened.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3331	When?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3332	Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3333	I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
3334	Did you talk to him?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3335	No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3336	He cried hard, huh?	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
3337	I could hear it right through the floor.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3338	I guess he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3339	Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3340	What's the meaning in that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3341	I don't know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3342	But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3343	Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3344	What do you mean, dishonest?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3345	What, you're going to argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3346	You can't tell him that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3347	We got to tell him that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3348	You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3349	They do come back.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3350	I know, but he doesn't know that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3351	Three years has been a long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3352	All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3353	It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
3354	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3355	You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3356	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3357	You know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3358	Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3359	I want to ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3360	Well, that's only your business, Chris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3361	Come on, you know that's not only my business.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3362	Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3363	So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3364	Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3365	God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3366	No, she is not Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3367	If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3368	'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3369	Oh, I don't know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3370	What do you want from me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3371	Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3372	To hell with that.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3373	There's nothing wrong with it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3374	I didn't ask Annie yet.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3375	You didn't ask her yet?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3376	Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3377	I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3378	Mom, don't avoid me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3379	You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
3380	Because it is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3381	That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3382	I just-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3383	I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
3384	It just is. I-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3385	I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3386	No, I don't want a diagram.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3387	Okay. All right, then.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3388	Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3389	No, I've given it three years of thought.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3390	And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3391	But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3392	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3393	You're crazy.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3394	I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3395	The business. The business doesn't inspire me.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
3396	Oh, you have to be inspired.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3397	Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3398	Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3399	You'd leave that business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3400	Yes. On this I would.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3401	You can't do that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3402	All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3403	We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3404	Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3405	I'm going to.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3406	You just can't talk like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3407	I don't know you, do I?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3408	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3409	Yeah. I can see that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3410	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3411	You knew there was nothing in that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3412	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3413	Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
3414	I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3415	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
3416	Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3417	You let him kiss you. You said so.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3418	What of it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3419	Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3420	What about me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3421	Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3422	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3423	Are you bored with this conversation?	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
3424	So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
3425	No, thanks.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3426	I'll have a little, I think.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3427	I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3428	No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3429	I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3430	Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3431	It's become a habit with you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3432	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3433	Don't be so stupid.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3434	Really, Amanda.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3435	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3436	Nothing.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3437	Going somewhere, dear?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3438	No. Just making myself fascinating for you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3439	That reply has broken my heart.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3440	It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3441	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3442	No, it isn't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3443	Yes, it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3444	Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
3445	Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
3446	Adders don't snap, they sting.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3447	They sting.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
3448	They snap.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3449	I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3450	Uhh,	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3451	did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3452	Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3453	I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3454	Mind your business.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3455	I'm not in the least bit drunk.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3456	You've always had a weak head.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
3457	Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3458	Do shut up. Shut up.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

3471	Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3472	You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

3496	It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3497	Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3498	You guys were pretty close, weren't you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3499	He was like, he was like my brother, you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

3534	Look, I'm cold.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

3536	It's past eleven, let's go.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3537	What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3538	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3539	That's my point.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3540	That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3541	So let's go.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3542	I mean, don't you want to see it?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
3543	Not particularly.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3544	Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
3545	Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3546	But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3547	What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3548	Yeah they do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3549	Augie.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3550	Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3551	I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3552	For real?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3553	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3554	I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3555	And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
3556	Okay.  We're in a good spot.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3557	Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3558	You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
3559	I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3560	Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
3561	...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3562	They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
3563	That's the wind.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3564	About what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3565	About what I just said?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3566	It's ridiculous.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3567	It certainly is not.  It's	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
3568	Yeah?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

4285	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4288	Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4289	Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4290	Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4291	We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4292	right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4294	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4295	It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4296	That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4313	No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4314	Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0

4319	I'm doing the best I can.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4320	I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4321	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4322	I didn't say that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4323	No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4324	For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4325	Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4326	Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4327	Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4328	I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4329	Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4330	Well look at what we got here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4331	Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4332	It's not champagne.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4333	Well then I guess we don't need glasses.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4334	You still cold?  Do you want to go home?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4335	I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4336	Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4337	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4338	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4339	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4340	I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
4341	So you're not sorry you came?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4342	No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4343	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4344	You saw that and then you've been kind of--	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4345	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4346	Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4347	The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4348	I knew they would, your mother, anyway.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4349	How did you know?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4350	From her point of view, why else would I come?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4351	Well wouldn't you want to?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4352	I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4353	Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4362	I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4363	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4365	I kissed you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4366	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4367	Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
4368	No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4369	No, no, nothing like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4370	Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4371	You've got to tell me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4372	I don't know where to start.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4373	It wouldn't work this way.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
4374	Well I lost them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4375	How many?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4376	Just about all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4377	Oh, gees.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4378	It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4379	They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
4380	And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4381	because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4382	to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4383	You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4384	I want you now, Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4385	Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4386	And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4398	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

4400	With the mo- with the most perfect poise?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
4401	Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4402	But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
4403	Don't say that, darling.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4404	It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4405	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4406	Yes, meaning just that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4407	What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4408	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

4410	Who's they?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4411	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4412	If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4413	Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4415	Who knows.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4416	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4417	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4418	Oh, dear.  Should we like that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4419	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4420	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4421	No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
4422	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4423	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
4424	Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4425	I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4426	Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

4442	Why does- why, does that bother you?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4443	Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4444	What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4445	Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

4454	How do you know why she waited?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
4455	Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

4509	Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4510	I'm trying to watch TV.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4511	Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4512	Yeah.  Yeah I did.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4513	Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4514	I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4515	Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4516	I understand that ma'am.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4517	it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4518	I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4519	At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4520	No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4521	you're getting very excited right now	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4522	Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4523	I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4524	Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
4525	What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4526	If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4527	I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4528	Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1

4530	It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4531	You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4532	Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4533	No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
4534	Ma'am.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4535	I want to talk to your supervisor.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4536	I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4537	I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4538	Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
4539	Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4540	Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4565	They have- they have that	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4566	They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4567	That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4568	Okay.  Well I'm lying but-	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4569	Seriously, what's your major?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

4572	Hey, that's cool.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4573	No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4625	Okay.  No, that's dorky.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4626	It's important.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4632	[LAUGHTER].	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4633	No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4634	Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4635	ditsy valley girls and	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4636	lots of drunk frat boys	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4637	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4638	But, hey. They have- they have- they have free, uh	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4639	What have you heard about the Greek system?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4640	free buffets and free events.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4641	I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4642	Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4643	I think I'll live on campus the first year cause you  meet more people that way, right?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4644	Oh, yeah? In a dorm?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4645	Well, yeah.  I mean that's where you meet people, right.  Everybody lives in the dorms, right.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4646	Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4647	No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4648	and I mean, you know, I knew my roommates and stuff but I there wasn't really that sense of community-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4649	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4650	that happened, you know, that was going on.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4651	So basically what you're saying is that I was right	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4652	I was just joking.  Gosh.  You don't have to take everything so- so seriously.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4653	me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4654	Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
4655	Thanks.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4656	When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4657	You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4658	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4659	Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4660	Yeah. I know. I know.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4661	you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4662	Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4663	He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4664	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4665	It just doesn't seem fair.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4666	It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4667	You're okay	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4668	Thank you for being here.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4669	You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4670	[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4671	And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4672	Yeah, I know.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4673	So-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4674	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4675	Fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4676	Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4677	How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0

4681	Well, sure.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4682	No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4683	I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4684	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4685	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1

4690	Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4691	There is no point in coming down here.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
4692	That's my point.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4693	So let's go home.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4694	No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
4695	I just don't.  It's stupid.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
4696	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4697	Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

4700	Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4701	This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
4702	Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4703	I'm just not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4704	For real?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4705	I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4706	Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
4707	We weren't in a good spot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4708	We didn't see them the first time either.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4709	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4710	just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4718	And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

4720	You don't know that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4721	I need you to believe that too.  How am I supposed to believe everything's going to be okay if you don't?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4722	I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4723	You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4724	Do you think I want to leave you?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4725	You have a choice.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4726	I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4727	Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4728	And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
4729	What's that supposed to mean?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
4730	I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4731	Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4732	Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4733	I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4734	Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4735	You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4736	You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4737	I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
4738	That's all I'm saying... No you don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4742	I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
4743	Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
4744	I will but I can't right now.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4745	Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4746	You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4747	Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4748	I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
4749	You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4750	I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1
4751	Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4752	Are you sure you didn't make them?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4753	I'm positive.  They came from like another state.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4754	Can I get your phone number, please?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4755	Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4756	I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4757	Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4758	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4759	Okay, cool.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4760	Umm, Miss Aruckman	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1
4761	I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4762	Well I'm looking at these.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4763	So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4764	Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4765	So could you discretion it back?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4766	Okay, but that's like half	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4767	What I can	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4768	of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4769	What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4770	which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4771	Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
4772	but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4773	Ma'am, I understand that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4774	And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
4775	Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4776	Excuse me?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4777	And then then you'll get some money back.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4778	How long does that take?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4779	Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4780	Really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4781	I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
4782	So you're just going to take care of this for me?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4783	Sure.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4784	Oh, my God, thank you so much.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4785	I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4786	No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

4796	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
4797	There was nothing in that, you know that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4798	Presents a trivial little broach.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4799	I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4800	Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4801	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
4802	I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4803	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4804	Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4805	It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

4807	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4832	Yes, I did quite a lot.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4833	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4879	What do you mean dishonest?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4880	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4881	What do you want to do, argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4882	I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4883	Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4884	You can't say that to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4885	We've got to say it to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4886	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

4888	Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4889	The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4891	You know why.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4892	Well I got an idea but what's the story?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
4893	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4894	Well that's only your business, Chris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
4895	Then it isn't just my business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4896	Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
4897	Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4898	Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4899	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
4900	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4901	To hell with that.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4902	How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
4903	Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4904	and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4905	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
4906	So what I'm not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
4907	Because it is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4908	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4911	Alright then mom.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
4912	and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
4913	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
4914	I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

4918	Must you be inspired?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

4999	Well so what'd you think?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5000	Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5001	I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5002	Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5003	Are we talking about the same thing?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5004	Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5005	Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
5006	Well what's bugging you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5007	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5008	That's not ever.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5012	No, of course, not.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5013	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5014	It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
5015	You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5016	Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

5019	Uh.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5020	It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5021	And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5022	Wait a minute, I've got it.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
5023	Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5024	It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5025	I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1

5037	Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5038	No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5039	And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
5040	Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1

5044	I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5045	Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5046	I didn't say that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5047	No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5049	Yeah?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5050	Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5051	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5052	I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1

5178	And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5179	a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5180	The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5181	because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5182	I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5183	I mean you can take those things out of war but	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
5184	when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
5185	I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

5207	How do you know why she waited?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

5294	You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5295	It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5296	This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0

5304	I don't have any magic answers.  But,	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5305	I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5306	Well there has to be something you haven't tried.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5307	I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5308	local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

5310	Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5311	there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5312	Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5313	Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5314	I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5315	But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5316	Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5317	No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5318	Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5319	I'm not choosing. I'm not-	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5320	If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5321	No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5322	This is stupid.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5323	I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5324	You know what, this is your fault.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5325	Excuse me?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5326	It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5327	It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5328	Yeah, exactly.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
5329	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5330	That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5331	-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5332	Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5333	I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5334	Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5371	All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5372	But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5647	I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5648	We weren't in a good spot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5649	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5650	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5651	And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5652	Well, so what do you think?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5653	How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5654	He was out here when it broke.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
5655	When?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5656	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5657	Did you talk to him?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5658	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5659	He cried hard.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5660	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5661	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5662	I guess, he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5663	What's the meaning of that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5664	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5665	What do you mean, dishonest?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5666	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5667	What are you going to do, argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5668	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5669	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5670	You can't just say that to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5671	How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5672	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5673	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5674	The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5675	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

5688	So what, I'm not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5689	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5690	Because it is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5691	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5692	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5693	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5694	All right, then, Mom.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5695	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5696	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5697	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5698	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
5699	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
5700	Must you be inspired?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5701	Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0

5725	You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5726	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

5739	I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5740	Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
5741	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5742	Which particular one?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5743	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5744	Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5745	Horrible thing, I hate it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

5747	How long did that row last?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5748	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5749	Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5750	Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5751	That was the first time you ever hit me.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
5752	And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5753	Oh, we were very much younger then.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5754	And very much sillier.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5755	Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5756	You knew there was nothing.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5757	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5762	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5763	Well your mother has much as told me to leave.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5764	Well--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5765	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5766	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5767	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5768	I figured they would- your mother at least.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5769	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5770	Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

5773	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5774	Chris, I've been ready for a long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

5776	I almost got married two years ago.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5777	You started to write me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

5779	Every day since.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5780	Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
5781	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

5787	No, nothing like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5788	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5789	I don't know how to start.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5790	It wouldn't work like this.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5791	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5792	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5793	yeah sure.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5794	Yeah.  I lost them.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5795	just about all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5796	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5797	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5798	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5799	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5800	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5801	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5802	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5803	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5804	Do you still feel like that?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5805	I I want you now, Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5806	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5807	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5808	Well, so, what do you think?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

5822	Well, we'll see them this year.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5823	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5824	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0

5827	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.

5837	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5838	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5839	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5840	This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5841	Yes, it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5842	Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
5843	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5844	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5845	Now, I know.  Me either	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5846	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5847	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5848	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5849	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5850	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5851	Really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5852	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5853	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5854	Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5855	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5856	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5857	Augie, you brought refreshments.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5858	Well, it isn't champagne.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5859	Well, then we don't need glasses.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5860	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5861	Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5862	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5863	Or not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5864	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5865	Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5866	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5867	What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5868	He's not going to marry her.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5869	Well, so what.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5870	What's going on here, Joe?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5871	Now, listen, Kate, just-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5872	She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5873	You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5874	Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5875	Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5876	Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5877	I want you to pretend like he's coming back!	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
5878	But, Kate...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5879	Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
5880	[LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5881	Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
5882	Calm yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5883	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
5884	Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5885	All right, all right.  Calm yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5886	Why me, above all?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5887	You've got to believe. You've got to--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5888	What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5889	I can't help it!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5890	Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5891	Oh You knew there was nothing in that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5892	I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5893	Only a trivial little broach.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5894	I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5895	You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5896	Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5897	Well, what of it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5898	what of it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5899	What about me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5900	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5901	I'm getting very bored with this conversation.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
5902	Me, too, bored stiff.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
5903	Do you want some brandy?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5904	I think I'll have a little.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5905	No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5906	Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5907	You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5908	It's becoming a habit with you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5909	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5910	Don't be stupid.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5911	Amanda, really.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5912	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5913	Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
5914	It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5915	Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5916	No, it isn't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5917	Yes, it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5918	No, it it is not, be quiet.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5919	It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
5920	hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5921	Adders don't snap, they sting.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5922	Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5923	They sting.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
5924	They snap.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5925	Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5926	So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5927	You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5928	[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5929	I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5930	I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5931	Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5932	Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5933	You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5934	Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5935	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5936	Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5937	They're away in Tunis.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5938	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5939	Turn it on again, please.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5940	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5941	Turn it off!	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5942	Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5943	You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5944	Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5945	You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5946	Oh, you're not going like this.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5947	[GARBAGE] No, you're not.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5948	You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5949	oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5950	You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5951	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5952	He was out here when it broke.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
5953	About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5954	What was he doing out here four in the morning?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5955	I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
5956	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5957	He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5958	Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5959	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5960	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5961	What are you gonna do, argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5962	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
5963	Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5964	You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5965	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5966	All right.  All right, just listen.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5967	You know why I invited Annie, right?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5968	You know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5969	Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
5970	I'm gonna ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5971	Well, that's your business, Chris.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5972	You know it's not just my business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5973	What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
5974	So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5975	So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime, you know that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5976	Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5977	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5978	She's not Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5979	Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5980	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
5981	what to hell with that!	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5982	Have you asked Annie yet?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5983	Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5984	So what, I'm not fast with women?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
5985	Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
5986	she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5987	Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
5988	All right then, mom.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
5989	Just give it some more thought.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5990	But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5991	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5992	I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5993	I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5994	But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
5995	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
5996	Must you be inspired?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5997	Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5998	I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
5999	All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6000	I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6001	Don't think like that, do you hear me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6002	I don't understand you, do I?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6003	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6004	Okay, so big news.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6005	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6006	Come on, what?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6007	I'm getting married.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6008	Shut up.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6009	No way.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6010	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6011	No way, when? when,when, When did it happen?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6012	Oh my gosh.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6013	[LAUGHTER]	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
6014	And you actually said yes.  I can't believe it.  I never thought you would get married.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6015	I know me neither.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6016	Oh absolutely.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6017	Well, we always said we'd be in our thirtieth when we got married. And we were going to get married to each other if we didn't by then	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6018	I know, right. What'd we say, when we were thirty nine?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6019	Thirty nine, yeah.  I can't believe it.  So you broke our pact. Thanks a lot.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6020	Sorry.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6021	Thanks a lot.  Well, okay, you've got to tell me the details.  What did he say?  Where was it?  What happened?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6022	Um, Well, uh, I don't-I don't know how much planning he had done.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6023	It was really beautiful.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6024	You've got to love that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6025	Nice, you love the jazz.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6026	Oh, okay, yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6027	So you know like late dinner and champagne and what not.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6028	Were you in Chicago?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6029	What a guy.  I can't believe it.  So okay, so do you know any details?  When's it going to be?  Anything?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6030	I don't know.  I guess next summer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6031	Yeah.  Yeah, of course.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6032	So next fall I guess.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
6033	Next fall.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
6034	Are you going to do it in town or are you out of town?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6035	oh, We'll do it in town.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6036	Oh, okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6037	Yeah, where's he from again?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

6039	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6040	Exactly, yeah.  I can't believe you met him in Africa.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

6124	I just don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6125	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6126	Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6127	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6128	Yeah they do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6129	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

6138	Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
6139	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6140	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6141	That's the wind.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6213	yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6214	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6215	Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6216	Oh really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6223	It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

6243	What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6244	I guess he is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6245	What's the meaning of that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6246	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6247	What do you mean dishonest?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6248	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6249	What do you want to do, argue with him?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6250	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6251	You can't say that to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6252	We have to say it to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6253	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6254	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6255	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6256	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6257	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6258	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6259	Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6260	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6261	It's not just my business.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6262	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6263	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6264	I'm just saying.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6265	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6266	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
6267	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6268	She is not Larry's girl!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6269	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6270	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
6271	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6272	Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6273	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6274	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6275	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6276	Because it is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6277	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6278	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6279	Just give it some more thought.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6280	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6281	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6282	Are you crazy?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6283	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6284	What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6285	Yes.  On this, I would.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6286	You can't think like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6287	Well, you help me stay here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6288	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6289	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6290	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6291	I am thinking that way.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6292	Yeah, I can see that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6293	I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6294	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6295	So, you're not sorry I came?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6296	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6297	Well-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6298	You saw that.  And well you've been --	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6299	What?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6300	You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6301	Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6302	Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6303	Yes, that's why I came.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6304	Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6305	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6306	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6307	So he's gone forever then?  You sure?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6308	You started to write me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6309	You felt something that far back?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6310	Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6311	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
6312	Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6313	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6314	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6315	Not like that you're not.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6316	I kissed you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6317	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6318	Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
6319	No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6320	No, nothing like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6321	You have to tell me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6322	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
6323	You have to tell me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6324	I don't I don't know where to start.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6325	It wouldn't work like this.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6326	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6327	You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6328	I lost them.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6329	Just about all.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6330	For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
6331	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
6332	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6333	Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6334	I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6335	So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6336	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
6337	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6338	And I guess that included you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6339	I want you now, Annie.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6340	And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6341	Oh, Annie,	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6342	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6343	Oh Good God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
6344	Do you think it's them?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6345	I wonder.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6346	What do we do?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6347	Now and always, my sweet.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6349	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
6350	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
6351	Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6352	With the worst- with the most perfect poise?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
6353	I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
6354	Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6355	things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6356	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6357	Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6358	Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
6359	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6360	You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6361	uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
6362	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6363	Well, will we always bicker and fight?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6364	Well, it depends on how well we played.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6365	What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6366	Yes, yes, with all his might.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6367	No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6368	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6369	[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6370	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6371	Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
6372	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6373	Which particular one?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6374	The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6375	Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6376	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6377	I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6378	How long did that roue last?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6379	It went on intermittently for days.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

6384	Very much sillier.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6385	You knew there was nothing in that.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6386	It's ridiculous.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

6395	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6396	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6397	Why not?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6400	Well We will see them this year.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6401	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6402	I thought you wanted to see it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6403	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6404	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6405	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6406	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6407	When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6408	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6409	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6410	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6411	Wait a minute, I got it.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
6412	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6413	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6414	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1
6415	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6416	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6417	You want me to go get some champagne?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

6422	No no.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6423	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6424	What.  Welcome to the human race.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6425	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6426	Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6427	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6428	Yes it is.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6429	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6430	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6431	No, I know me either.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6432	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6433	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6434	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
6435	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6462	Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6463	I don't-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6464	I don't have time for this today, and-	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0

6469	Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6470	what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

6494	Now listen.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6495	You don't know.  You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6496	Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
6497	How do you know why she's waited?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

6501	No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
6502	But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

6509	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6510	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6511	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6512	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6513	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6514	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6515	That's good.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6516	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6517	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6518	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6519	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6520	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6521	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6522	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6523	And you couldn't find it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6524	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6525	Are you sure?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6526	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6527	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6528	--really important stuff.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6529	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6530	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6531	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6532	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6533	I am sorry, ma'am.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6534	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
6535	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6536	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6537	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
6538	Right. Yes, ma'am.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6539	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6540	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
6541	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6542	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6543	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6544	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6545	Uh, so it was really heavy.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6546	So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6547	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6548	There's nothing else you can do?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6549	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6550	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6551	No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6552	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6553	makes up?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6554	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6555	You could go into the computer and- you know- print-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6556	I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
6557	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
6558	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6559	And you have no guarantee.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6560	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6561	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6562	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
6563	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
6564	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6565	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6566	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6567	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6568	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6569	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

6736	What do you mean?  I filled out my forms and I rushed to get my I.D.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6737	Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6738	The wrong form?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6739	Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6740	What's wrong about this form?  It says new I.D. on it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
6741	No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
6742	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6743	Sir, don't get an attitude with me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6744	I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6745	No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6746	yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
6747	right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6748	Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6749	I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
6750	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6751	You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6752	I know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6753	Sir, you- I mean	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6754	Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6755	You can waist as much as you want	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
6756	Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
6757	I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6758	Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6759	Sir, please don't waste my time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6760	There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6761	Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6762	They're different forms, we process them all different-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6763	I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
6764	Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
6765	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6766	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6767	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
6768	But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
6769	Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
6770	This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0

6786	Oh, my God.  That's so dramatic.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
