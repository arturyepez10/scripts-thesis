299	You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
300	I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
301	You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

346	Okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
347	I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
348	Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
349	No G.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
350	all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
351	Flight seven fourteen.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
352	Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

357	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

359	Okay. Calm-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
360	Do you understand who my husband is?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
361	You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
362	Because I probably know him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
363	Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
364	Sean.  Great. Do you have a badge number or something?	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
365	Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
366	Okay.  I'll do that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
367	Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
368	Yeah. That is so awesome.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
369	Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0

1009	So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1010	Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

1021	Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1022	Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1023	I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1024	It doesn't make any easier, yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1031	Then she's gone.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

1062	Okay. Well, um- the f.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1063	Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1064	Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1065	Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1066	I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1067	It's worth a lot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1068	I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1069	they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1070	But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1071	Theft?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1072	Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1073	I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1074	This is unbelievable. I've got	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1075	you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1076	so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1077	all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1078	Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1079	The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1080	Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1081	we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1082	because this is ridiculous?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1083	I'm sorry. I don't- I-	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1084	I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1085	Fine.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1086	So how you feeling?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1090	you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1091	But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1092	I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1093	I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1094	So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1095	You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1096	Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1097	Why does that bother you?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1098	Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1249	Baltimore and this is a direct flight to LAX	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1250	Okay.  Well you um-...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1251	Now what are you going to do for me different? Hmm?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1252	the luggage was left in Baltimore.  Therefore--	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1253	Like the luggage, the luggage on the flight.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1254	Well, we can give you um- hotel lodging for a night if that--	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1255	We can do Holiday Inn or...?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1256	Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1257	Did you have your name tags on the luggage?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1258	Uh no I'm not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1259	Okay sir.  I'm sorry you can--um-	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

1261	Yes sir, Yes.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1262	We can have them direct your luggage to San Diego.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1263	Some peanuts?  Wow.  That helps a lot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1264	I will never do business with Delta again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1265	I don't know, Brian, if they uh--it's been three years.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1266	No, don't think like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1267	I have no money behind me. Nothing. I'm twenty five and--	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1268	So I'll have to wait twenty five years-	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1269	I know, I just don't know if I can handle it. I mean, you're helping me so much financially it's like I can't survive on my own without you. I don't like that.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1270	Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1271	Time is passing by. Every year it's	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1272	a part left than I can do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1273	Really?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1274	That's the thing. I don't know. I don't know anything.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1275	Law school? Maybe.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1276	I don't know. I don't know anything other than this, though, is the problem. This is my life. This is what I built everything about, you know.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1277	See? So you can't just quit now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1278	Have you been going to auditions and stuff?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1279	Yeah. I mean, I get a call-back and stuff, but-	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1280	Yeah, so I go to--get an education for four years and I'm waiting tables at Denny's.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1
1281	[BREATHING] Brian-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1282	Yeah	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1283	Thanks.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1284	[BREATHING]	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1285	What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1286	She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1287	You can't read her mind.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1288	She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1289	Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1290	Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1291	Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1292	All right. All right. Calm yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1293	You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
1294	No, you've got to believe.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1295	I can't help it.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1296	What have I got to hide?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1297	Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1298	Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1299	You're not sorry you came?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1300	Well-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1301	Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1302	Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1303	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1304	How did you know?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1305	Well, uh- would you want to?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1306	Annie, I love you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1307	I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1308	I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1309	I was almost married two years ago.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1310	Why didn't you?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1311	Not like that, you're not.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1312	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1313	Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1314	You should tell me.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1315	You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1316	How many?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1317	And I, and I thought something watching them go down.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1318	And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1319	And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1320	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
1321	And you still feel that way?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1322	Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1323	What am I going to do with a fortune?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1324	Good God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1325	Yes, meaning just that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1326	What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1327	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1328	No. The fire will fade along with our passion.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1329	Oh dear, well, shall we want that?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1330	So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1331	Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1332	Horrible little thing. I hated it.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1333	The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1334	I didn't hit you very hard.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1335	Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1336	Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1337	I had my luggage transferred here from Paris to L.A. and now I'm here and I need to be working and I have all my stuff in there.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1338	Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1339	No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1340	Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1341	You know, we'll file a complaint and we could possibly, you know, replace some of the things. I think-	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1342	and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1343	Sir, why are you laughing at me? This isn't funny.	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
1344	I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1345	About what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1346	It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1347	It's just...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1348	Why not?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1349	We never do, do we?  Have we ever?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1350	Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1351	Carla, can I ask you something?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1352	What's bugging you then?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1353	Well, we're going to see it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1354	And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1355	Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1356	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1357	Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1358	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1359	Do you want me to get some champagne?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1360	Take off our shoes?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1361	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1362	Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1363	I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1364	This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1365	Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1366	This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1367	I didn't say that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1368	I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1369	Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1370	Yeah.  Don't you know that?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1371	Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1373	Big old white moon.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1374	It's not champagne.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1409	What was he doing out at four in the morning?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1410	What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1411	Well, what do you mean? What?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1412	You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1413	No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1414	We can't. It just won't work.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0

1416	See, then it's not just my business. God, you have	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

1418	Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1419	And she-she's Larry's girl.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1420	Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1421	You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1422	I wanted to get this settled first.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1423	Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1424	So what? I'm not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1425	I don't understand why it has to be her.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1426	He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1427	I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1428	You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1429	Now, where do I find it?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1430	Tell me something.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1432	Okay. Just-	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1433	I am thinking like that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1434	Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1435	No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1436	You must admit that he was in love with you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1437	Well, what of it?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1438	Well, it's true.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1439	I definitely, most definitely am.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1440	No, it's not. I don't care.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1441	It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
1442	Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1443	You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1444	You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1445	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1446	Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1447	I don't want to talk about this anymore.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1448	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
1449	No, I will do no such thing.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1450	Turn it on.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1451	You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1655	American Pie? Ah.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1656	Yeah.  Well...	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1657	Barry what's this?  And I go, I don't know.  She goes--	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1658	That's my name.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1659	[LAUGHTER] So nasty. No you... dirty me?	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
1660	Sara and I--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1661	She actually asked if it was real?  I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1662	Oh, man. How old are you? Five?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1663	Yeah.  That's, you know, okay.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1664	I got all the character animals to do a conga line,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1665	dim down the lights and uh, I got on one of the tables pulled her up.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1666	Yeah.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1667	You're my guiding light, then they put on that song the I've had the time of my life, that song.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1668	Oh my God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1669	Okay, that is really cheesy Joe.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1670	And I love you baby.  And I want you to marry me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1671	No. Well that's what I said, spur of the moment--and she goes, she goes,	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1672	She said sure?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1673	Yeah, she goes--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1674	About two and a half weeks.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1675	Two and ...  We love each other. Yeah.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1676	Okay.  I haven't seen you in about two and a half years and I come back and you're getting engaged to somebody you only knew for	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1677	You got to meet her, she's wonderful.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1678	She must be hot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1679	Yeah, that's it.  She's hot and you are- getting married.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1680	Yeah, she is good-looking.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1681	You still act like a boy.  And men take a lot longer to grow----I will tell you.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1682	Well that's why I'm dating someone who's just eighteen years old. Jesus. I think she's ready to have kids already.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1683	I'm still working at my parents' restaurant. Busing tables.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1684	Alright. Yeah.  Have a kid.  Make a beautiful life.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1685	Oh that's great. My mom said we can move in with her again if we run out of money.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1686	Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1687	although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1688	Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1689	It's ours.  It's mine too.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1690	You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1691	I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1692	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1693	Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1694	Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1695	I'm cold.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1696	Do you want my jacket?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1697	It's after eleven let's go home.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1698	There is no point in coming down here.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1699	So let's go home.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1700	Why not?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1701	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1702	Yeah, they do.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1703	Oh, Augie.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1704	Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1705	a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1706	I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1707	We weren't in a good spot.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1708	No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1709	They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1710	About what?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1711	I shall never forget his face.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1712	Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1713	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1714	Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1715	Line?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1716	Let him kiss you.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1717	It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1718	I'll have a little myself, I think.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1719	It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1720	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1721	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1722	Line?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1723	It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1724	Adders don't snap, they sting.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1725	They sting.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
1726	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1727	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1728	You must have had a riotous time.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1729	I'm not in the least drunk.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1730	On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1731	Oh, shut up.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1732	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1733	Turn it on again, please.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1734	I will do no such thing.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1735	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
1736	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1737	You're a vile tempered, loosed living	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1738	Stop.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1739	wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1740	This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1741	Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1742	He saw it.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
1743	You can't say that to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1744	For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1745	Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1746	Why?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1747	Well I've got an idea, but what's the story?	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1748	Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1749	From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1750	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1751	To hell with that.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1752	Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1753	The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
1754	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1755	Yeah, let's keep going.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
1756	Just give it some more thought.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1757	I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1758	father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1759	What the hell is this?	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1760	Must you be inspired?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1761	Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1762	I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1763	You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1764	Yes, on this I would.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1765	Then you help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1766	Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
1767	I know that.  Just you help me stay here.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1768	I don't understand you, do I?	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1769	It's ridiculous.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1770	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1771	It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1772	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0
1773	Well then what's bugging you?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1774	We never do.  Do we have we ever?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1775	and the fish won't show up.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1776	I thought you wanted to see it.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1777	I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1778	and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1779	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1780	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1781	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1782	No.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1783	Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1784	Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
1785	Right.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1786	No, I know me either.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1787	This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1788	Yeah?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1789	somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1790	I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1791	It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1792	In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1793	I guess this is why I came.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1794	I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1795	I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1796	You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1797	Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1798	I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1799	Not like that you're not.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1800	Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
1801	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1802	Yeah, sure.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1803	For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1804	a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1805	There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1806	And do you still feel that way?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1807	Good God.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0
1808	Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1809	Behave exquisitely.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1810	Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1811	It all depends on how well we've played.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1812	Yes.  Yes, with all his might.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1813	Elliot, worms don't pop.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
1814	The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1815	I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1816	How long did that row last?	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1817	It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0
1818	I didn't hit you very hard.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1819	The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
1820	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
1821	Why does that bother you?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1822	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1823	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1824	Line.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1825	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1826	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
1827	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
1828	But, Kate--	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1829	Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
1830	She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1836	What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1837	I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1838	and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1839	I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
1840	Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1841	Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1864	Ma'am, I understand that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1866	Wait.  What?	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
1867	You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

1946	Yes.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
1947	no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
1948	Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
1949	They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
1950	Well so what did you think?	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

2354	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2355	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0

2375	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

2377	Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
